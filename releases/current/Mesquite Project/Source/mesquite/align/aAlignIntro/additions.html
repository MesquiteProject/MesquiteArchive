You can set the method to color cells using the Matrix&gt;Color cells   submenu. Three useful methods are:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Character State</strong> &#8212; This colors cells according to     nucleotide. This is the default coloring, but in case it has been turned off,     you can turn it back on by going to Matrix&gt;Color Cells&gt;Character State.</li>  <li><strong>Aligning Colors</strong> &#8212; This colors pyrimidines by similar     colors, and likewise purines</li>  <li><strong>Highlight Apparently Slightly Misaligned</strong> &#8212; This highlights     subsequences that appear better shifted one or two sites left or right:<br>    <img src="colorMisaligned.jpg" width="249" height="252"> <br>    It bases its calculations on the dominant nucleotides in the columns, and     hence is useful only in a matrix that is mostly well aligned. Shifts more     distant than one or two sites are not considered. Do not consider this a definitive     indication that the cells should move; its purpose is only to help you find     possible issues, but the decision as to whether to shift or not is still up     to you. The highlight does not specify which direction the subsequences might     be best shifted; to learn this, hold the cursor over the sites in question.</li></ul><h3>Selecting Hint</h3><p>To select from one cell to the end of the sequence, select the cell and then   hit Shift-Alt-Arrow key (or, on OS X, Shift-Option-Arrow key), where the arrow   key is either the right or left arrow key.</p><h3>Preparing the Matrix</h3><p>Several options under Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform may be useful to modify the   matrix in preparation for alignment. Some of these options are under &quot;Other   Choices...&quot;.</p><ul>  <li>Collapse Gaps to Left</li>  <li>Collapse Gaps to Right</li>  <li>Trim Terminal Gaps Character</li>  <li>Gaps to Missing </li>  <li>Missing to Gaps</li>  <li>Terminal Gaps to ?</li>  <li>Terminal ? to Gaps</li>  <li>Reverse Complement</li>  <li>Reverse</li>  <li>Nucleotide Complement</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
