		<h2>Mesquite installation for UNIX/LINUX</h2>

		
<p>(Please email us at <img src="../images/email.jpg" width="189" height="17">) 
  with questions or comments about downloading Mesquite).</p>
		
        
<p>Requirements: JRE or JDK 1.4 or better (<a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>). 
  (It is best to get Sun's Java VM; Mesquite does not run on some third-party 
  virtual machines.) See notes on the <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">support</a> 
  page, especially regarding issues with window and dialog size and placement.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Download and decompress this file:</p>
		<ul>
  <li type="disc"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/mesquite.tgz">.tgz 
    file</a> 
</ul>
		
<p> It will create a directory called &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot; in which all 
  the relevant files reside. To start Mesquite, execute the run_mesquite.sh script from the command line:
   <pre>     ./run_mesquite.sh</pre> 
This should automatically identify your java installation. If you have trouble, you may need to set your 
JAVA_HOME environment variable. In the uncommon case that you want a java VM to run Mesquite that is different 
from the VM identified in JAVA_HOME, you may set the MESQUITE_JAVA_HOME environment variable.
</p>

<p>Once Mesquite has finished loading, go to the File menu to open a file.</p>
<p>If the current user directory is not the Mesquite_Folder, and Mesquite has
  not been run before, Mesquite may ask you to find the file &quot;manual.html&quot;
  which resides in the <b>Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/</b> directory. This will
  help Mesquite find and remember where its files are.</p>


<h3>If run_mesquite.sh fails</h3>

In the event that the shell script fails, it may still be posible to run Mesquite manually. The main class file is mesquite.Mesquite.

To start Mesquite you can use jre or java. For instance you could use:</p>
		<pre>
     java -cp /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>
		<p>where /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder could be replaced by whatever is the
		  path to the Mesquite_Folder. On some systems the java virtual machine
		  is started by &quot;jre&quot; instead
		  of &quot;java&quot;, and thus the command would be:</p>

		<pre>
     jre -cp /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>
		<p>Depending on your configuration, you may need to give the explicit path
		  to the java virtual machine, as in:</p>
		<pre>/usr/java/jre1.4.2/bin/java -cp /usr/local/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>
		
<p>If you've changed the name of Mesquite_Folder to, for instance, &quot;Mesquite2&quot;, 
  you may need to use a command like:</p>
		<pre>/usr/java/jre1.4.2/bin/java -cp /usr/local/Mesquite2 mesquite.Mesquite</pre>

        <p></p>
        <p>If you've had to do all this because the shell script isn't working, please let us know 
what happened, and what you did to make Mesquite work. That way, we can make it easier for the next person.</p>

		<h3>Window Managers</h3>
		<p>Mesquite attempts to place windows in particular places on the screen for ease of use, using standard Java calls. 
		Some window managers override this, resulting in haphazard placement of windows. You may need to change your window 
		manager if this sort of thing is happening.</p>
		
<h3><a name="ubuntuJVM"></a>Virtual Machines &amp; Ubuntu</h3>
	<p>If you are running Ubuntu 8.10 (other versions have not been tested but may have the same issue), your default JVM may
	be Open Java, which has some problems with font rendering/spacing.  It is recommended that you use Sun's virtual machine.
	Java 6 can be installed with the Synaptic Package Manager (sun-java6-jre for running Mesquite, 
	sun-java6-jdk if you are programming in Mesquite) or via the command line &quot;apt-get install&quot; process.</p>
	
	<p>If you have multiple JVMs installed, you may need to edit the run_mesquite.sh file to instruct Mesquite where to look for
	the virtual machine.  To do this, open run_mesquite.sh in a text editor and find the line:</p>

	<pre>     java=&quot;java&quot;</pre>

	<p>Replace it (or comment it out, as below, using &quot;#&quot; and append it) with the absolute path to Sun's JVM 
	(which may be different than the path listed below):</p>
	
	<pre>     #java=&quot;java&quot;</pre>
	<pre>     java=&quot;/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10/bin/java&quot;</pre>

	<p>making sure to pay attention to spacing; the script may have problems if there is extra whitespace between &quot;java&quot; &amp; &quot;=&quot;.  
	Alternatively, if you don't use the script, but would like to run Mesquite from the Terminal command line, just use the absolute path to 
	the Java VM you prefer when starting Mesquite, as above:</p>
	
	<pre>     /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10/bin/java -cp /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>
