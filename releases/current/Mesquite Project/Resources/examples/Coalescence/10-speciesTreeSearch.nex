	TEXT  FILE TEXT = 'In this file is a stored gene tree.  Imagine that one sought to infer a species tree using the gene tree.  The species tree shown above containing the gene tree has a lot of discordance with the gene tree, indicated by the high cost (18) of "extra lineages" (also called "deep coalescences" by Maddison 1997).  You can try moving branches of the species tree to try find one that is more concordant with the gene tree.^n^nMesquite has a general concept of "a number for a tree".  Examples could be the treelength, the number of steps in a character, the likelihood of the tree, its symmetry, and so on.  Each of these is a number that applies to the tree.  For any given number for a tree, one might seek that tree which maximizes or minimizes it (e.g., minimizing treelength in a standard parsimony search).  The Tree Search modules allow one to search for a tree optimizing any such number for a tree available.  Here, we''d like to search for a species tree minimizing deep coalescences.  ^n^nTo do that, go to the Taxa&Trees menu and select "Heuristic" under "Tree Search" under the "Make Trees Block from" submenu.  Indicate you want to search for trees of "Species", and to use the criterion "Deep coalescences (species)", and use "Stored Trees" as the source of the contained trees (to use the stored gene tree).  The tree search modules currently do a simple addition sequence followed by branch rearrangements, and are much much much much slower than PAUP (for instance).  But, after humming for a while, they should indicate that the trees are ready.  When they are ready, you can go to the Tree menu of the tree window, and select the new tree block from the Tree Block submenu.  You''ll see a species tree with which the gene tree is much more concordant (a cost of only 4).^n';
