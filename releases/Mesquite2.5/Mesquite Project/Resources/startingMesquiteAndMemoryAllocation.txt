4. Or, to adjust how exactly Mesquite starts, including memory allocation:
Run Mesquite by double clicking the file run_mesquiteOSX.command.  If double clicking this file does not start Mesquite, select the file in the Finder, choose Get Info, and change the "Open With" to "Terminal.app", which is in /Applications/Utilities/

To give Mesquite even more memory, open the file with a text editor and edit the line:
