				setExplanation 'When you create a new file using the New menu item in the  File menu, Mesquite offers the chance to create a new block of taxa to go in the file.  It does this under the assumption that analyses will probably depend on a block of taxa being available.  This particular file doesn''t have any blocks of taxa, because its purpose is only to give you this message!^n^nYou can also create a new block of taxa after you already have a file open.  Mesquite allows more than one block of taxa to exist in a data file (for instance, one block for species, another for their contained gene sequences).^n^nTo create a new block of taxa, go to the Taxa&Trees menu.  (Terminal taxa are the leaves of the tree.)  Choose New Block of Taxa; a dialog box will appear in which you can enter the name of the block and the number of taxa.  Once you have the taxa made, a Taxa List window will appear.  You can edit the names of the taxa there.';
