		<h2>Mesquite installation for Windows</h2>
		
<p>(Please email us (<img src="../images/email.jpg" width="189" height="17">) 
  with questions or comments about downloading Mesquite).</p>
<p>NOTE: If you previously installed an older version of Mesquite, we recommend 
  you delete the <strong>Mesquite_Folder</strong> directory before installing 
  the new version. First, however, you may want to take from Mesquite_Folder/mesquite 
  any third party packages (e.g., PDAP, TreeSetViz) before deleting the directory.</p>
<p>In order to run Mesquite, you must have Java 1.4 or newer installed on your 
  computer. We recommend you install the latest version of Java before installing 
  Mesquite (<a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>).</p>
		
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstaller.exe">Mesquite 
    Installer</a>. There are also special installer for  high-memory version 
    of Mesquite (<a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstaller512.exe">512MB</a> memory dedicated to Mesquite; <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstaller1024.exe">1GB</a> dedicated). 
    You might want to use a high memory version if you are using many trees, 
    large trees, or large matrices.</li>
  <li>Run the installer. It runs as a wizard. Once it is done, you should see 
    a Mesquite folder something like this:<br>
    <br>
    <img  src="images/installWin3.gif" width="879" height="385"><br>
  </li>
  <li>The file &quot;Mesquite&quot; with the icon is the Mesquite executable. 
    Double click this to start Mesquite.</li>
  <li>You will notice a file called &quot;Run_Mesquite_Windows.bat&quot; in the 
    Mesquite_Folder. This is a batch file that contains the command line instruction 
    to start Mesquite. If you double click this file, Mesquite will start. We 
    include this file because you can modify the command line to change how Mesquite 
    runs when you double click the batch file. In particular, you can change the 
    number &quot;512&quot;, the memory allocation, to higher numbers if you need 
    more memory (don't introduce spaces!).</li>
</ol>
<p>More details of issues of using Mesquite under Windows are described in the 
  <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">Support</a> 
  page.</p>
