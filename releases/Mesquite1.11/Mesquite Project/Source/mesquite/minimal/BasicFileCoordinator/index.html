Maddison</h4>		<p>There more than 170 modules in the basic packages, not including specialized   ones in the parsimony and search packages. Documentation is not yet written   for these modules, although you can learn about them by using the Installed   Modules menu item in the Help menu when Mesquite is running. You are strongly   encouraged to view the example data files distributed with Mesquite for information   about how to perform basic functions.</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>&copy; Wayne Maddison and David Maddison, 1999-2001	</body></html>
