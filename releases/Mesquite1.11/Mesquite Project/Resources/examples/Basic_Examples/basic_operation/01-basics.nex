				setExplanation 'Mesquite has a few standard windows, such as the startup window, and the project and files window at left.  ^n^nThe Projects and Files window shows the files that are currently open, and some of their major components.  For instance, there is currently one file open, named "01-basics.nex" (to which this note belongs).  Included in the file are one block of taxa, a character matrix, and a tree block.^n^nMesquite automatically groups files into projects.  When you have only one file open, you can consider a "project" to be equivalent to that open file.  The idea of a project becomes useful if you link several files together.  If you link several files together so that their information can be combined in analyses, Mesquite considers all the linked files to belong to a single "project".  A subsequent example file will discuss linking and including files.^n^nThe Projects and Files window is a useful place to manage the contents of files.  If you touch on the labels (e.g., for taxa, matrices, etc.) in the window, a menu will drop down that will allow you to do various things to the object touched.  For example, touching on "Taxa: Fubonidians" yields a drop-down menu that will display the list of taxa, or allow you to rename or delete the taxa block, etc.  Also, as you pass the cursor over the  labels, the explanation area in the window gives useful information about the objects.^n^nHit the Next button in to go to the next example file.';
