To install Mesquite Beta 2

To run Mesquite, you need Java installed.  Mesquite 2 runs only on Java 1.4 and higher.  We suggest Java 1.5 or higher.

Once Mesquite_Folder is unzipped, you can start Mesquite as follows:

Or, to run Mesquite with more memory:
Run Mesquite by double clicking the file run_mesquiteOSX.command.  If double clicking this file does not start Mesquite, select the file in the Finder, choose Get Info, and change the "Open With" to "Terminal.app", which is in /Applications/Utilities/

To give Mesquite even more memory, open the file with a text editor and edit the line:
