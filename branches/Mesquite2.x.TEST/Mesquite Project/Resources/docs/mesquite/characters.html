<p>Characters and their character states are means by which to describe                 the features of organisms. Mesquite supports characters whose                 states are <strong>categorical</strong> (discrete and not necessarily                 ordered) or <strong>continuous</strong>. Special versions of categorical                 characters exist for DNA, RNA and protein sequence data. For more                 details specific to those types of characters, see the pages on                 <a href="molecular/molecular.html">molecular</a> and <a href="continuous/continuous.html">continuous</a>                 characters. Categorical characters other than molecular characters                 can have 55 states (by default symbols 0 - 9, A - H, K - N, P                 - Z, a - h, k - n, p - z).</p>              <p>Characters can exist within <strong>matrices</strong> that are                 stored in a data file. Thus, one matrix may store a series of                 categorical characters to describe phenotypic features. A separate                 matrix may store continous characters describing measurements                 taken from the organisms, while a third matrix may store DNA sequence                 data, in which each aligned site is treated as a character (Mesquite                 currently treats unaligned data as if it were aligned, though                 the alignment can be ignored). Each matrix may have only a single                 type of character, but a data file may contain more than one matrix.</p>              <p>Characters can also exist outside of matrices. For instance,                 characters may be created by <a href="RandomSimul/simChars.html">simulations                 and randomizations</a> and used directly in calculations, without                 at any point being captured in a matrix and stored in a file.</p>              <p>               <ul>                <li><a href="#creating">Creating a character matrix</a></li>                <li><a href="#deleting">Deleting and renaming character matrices</a></li>                <li><a href="#editor">The Character Matrix Editor</a>                   <ul>                    <li><a href="#undo">Undo</a></li>                    <li><a href="#adding">Adding, deleting, renaming and sorting                       taxa and characters</a></li>                    <li><a href="#entering">Entering character data</a></li>                    <li><a href="#selecting">Selecting taxa, characters and cells                       of the matrix</a></li>                    <li><a href="#searching">Searching the matrix</a></li>                    <li><a href="#copy">Copy/paste</a></li>                    <li><a href="#editing">Editing Names of Characters and States</a></li>                    <li><a href="#annotations">Annotations</a></li>                    <li><a href="#coloring">Coloring cells of the matrix</a></li>                    <li><a href="#alter">Alterations and Transformations</a></li>                  </ul>                </li>                <li><a href="#changing">Changing the attributes of characters</a></li>                <li><a href="#charting">Charting information about Characters</a></li>              </ul></p>              <h3><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a name="creating"></a>Creating a                 character matrix</font></h3>              <p>There are several ways to create a<font face="Trebuchet MS">                 character matrix to be stored in the file. Most simply, you can                 create a blank (empty) matrix by choosing<font size="-1"> <u>Characters&gt;New                 Empty Matrix</u></font>. In the dialog box that appears, name                 the character matrix and specify the number of characters. You                 will also need to choose the sort of data the matrix will contain                 (standard categorical, DNA (or RNA) sequence data, continuous,                 or protein sequence data). Normally, you will create an empty                 matrix if you are about to start entering observations about organisms.</font>               <p>It is also possible to create character matrices that are already                 filled with character states. For instance, if you want to make                 a duplicate of an existing character matrix, select <u><font size="-1">Characters&gt;Make                 New Matrix From&gt;Stored Matrices</font></u>. If you want to                 create a matrix from the contents of the clipboard, select <u><font size="-1">Characters&gt;Make                 New Matrix From&gt;Clipboard</font></u>. Other choices available                 under <u><font size="-1">Characters&gt;Make New Matrix From&gt;</font></u>                 allow you to make and store matrices resulting from simulations                 of character evolution, randomizations of existing matrices, or                 other sources.               <p>Character matrices can also be read from files, including those                 in NEXUS and other formats that can be imported. <font face="Trebuchet MS">               <h3><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a name="deleting"></a>Deleting and                 renaming matrices</font></h3>              <p>There are three places you can rename and delete character matrices:                 in the Character Matrix Editor, in the List of Character Matrices                 window, and in the Projects and Files window.               <p>In the Character Matrix Editor the Current Matrix submenu at                 the top of the matrix menu has menu items for renaming or deleting                 the matrix shown in the window.               <p>In the List of Character Matrices window (available in the Characters                 menu), you can rename a matrix by editing its name directly. To                 delete matrices, select the rows corresponding to the matrices                 to be deleted, and select <u>List&gt;Delete Selected Character                 Matrices</u>.               <p>To rename a matrix from the Projects and Files window, touch                 on the &quot;Character Matrix&quot; box:               <p align="center"><img src="images/project1.gif" width="305" height="139">               <p>A drop-down menu will appear with the option to rename the matrix.                 You can also use this drop-down menu to delete a matrix. </font>               <h2><a name="editor"></a>The Character Matrix Editor</h2>              <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Once you have a character matrix, you                 may edit it using Mesquite's Character Matrix Editor, available                 at the top of the Characters menu. This is a spreadsheet editor,                 similar in style to MacClade's. While the Mesquite editor can                 handle continuous data and has special utilities, for instance                 to compare matrices, it lacks MacClade's sophisticated features                 for viewing and alignment of molecular sequence data.</font> Because                 MacClade and Mesquite share the NEXUS file format, for most data                 files you will be able to edit matrices in either program to use                 in the other. Below are instructions as to how to edit a character                 matrix. Most of the editing can be done in the Character Matrix                 Editor, but some changes can be made in other windows.               <p>The Character Matrix Editor is controlled by the Matrix and Select                 menus, and by the tools in the palette at left. The Matrix menu                 contains items to change column widths (the Display submenu),                 change cell coloring, and to alter the character data.               <p>You can have more than one Matrix Editor visible for working                 on the same matrix. To get a second Editor, choose Extra Matrix                 Editor from the Characters menu. This may be useful if you want                 to have the editors set to different views (e.g., one on Birds                 eye view, or colored as translated to protein).               <p><i>Note that currently most changes you make to a character matrix                 <strong>cannot be undone</strong>!</i>               <p>&nbsp;               <table width="82%" border="0">                <tr>                   <td><strong>The Character Matrix Editor showing <font face="Trebuchet MS">morphological                     data </font></strong></td>                  <td><img src="images/BembMatrix.gif" width="477" height="310"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                   <td width="55%"><strong>The Character Matrix Editor showing                     DNA sequences</strong></td>                  <td width="45%"><p> <font face="Trebuchet MS"></font></p>                    <p><img src="images/DNAMatrix.gif" width="437" height="200"></p></td>                </tr>              </table>              <p>There are buttons at the lower left of the Character Matrix Editor                 to open the List of Characters window (<img src="images/listC.gif" width="16" height="12">)                 and the List of Taxa window (<img src="images/listT.gif" width="16" height="12">).                 Reciprocally, the List of Characters window has a button (<img src="images/matrix.gif" width="16" height="12">)                 to show the Character Matrix Editor.               <h3><a name="undo"></a>Undo</h3>              <p>Mesquite's character matrix editor has some ability to undo the                 last change made, depending on what that change was.

If                 the two taxa have the same states, this state is used for the                 fused taxon.

First,                 the Search area at the top of the window can be set to <strong>Search                 Data</strong> (set by clicking on the little icon until it shows                 as <img src="images/searchDicon.jpg" width="12" height="14">).                 Then, you can enter a search string and hit return. </p>              <p>Second, you can search the matrix using the Find commands in                 the Edit menu, and the Select by Search in the Select menu. In                 the Edit menu, Find String... selects the first instance cell                 in the matrix containing the given string of text. It searches                 first taxon names, the character names, the the character states                 within the matrix. You can find subsequent instances using the                 Find Again command. Find All selects all those cells containing                 a given string. Find Footnote operates like Find String, except                 that it highlights cells that contain footnotes with the given                 text. (To find text within the more elaborate Annotations, you                 will need to call up an annotations window using the Annotate                 (pencil) tool in the character matrix editor, then choose Find                 Annotation in the Notes menu.)</p>              <h3><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a name="copy"></a>Copy/paste </font></h3>              <p>You can copy taxon and character names from one region of the                 matrix to another and from one matrix to another. You can also                 copy one or more cells in the matrix to the Clipboard, and paste                 them into another region of the matrix, or into another matrix.                 Mesquite allows you to do with discontinuous selections, as long                 as the number of cells selected in the first taxon that is selected                 while copying is the same as the number of cells selected in the                 first taxon that is selected while pasting, and the same for subsequent                 taxa. That is, if you select two cells in taxon 3, one cell in                 taxon 5, and four cells in taxon 7, and copy this to the Clipboard,                 then when you paste, you must select two cells in the first taxon                 in which to paste, one in the next, and four in the last.               <p>Mesquite will not let you paste a block of cells into the matrix                 while you have selected a differently shaped block in the matrix.                 However, if you attempt to do that, Mesquite will offer to change                 the selection so that covers the same number of cells as in the                 selection. You may then attempt again to paste.               <h3><a name="editing"></a>Editing Names of Characters and States</h3>              <p>Character names can be assigned either by editing the column                 headings in the Character Matrix Editor, or by editing the character                 names directly in the List of Characters window.               <p>The State Names Editor, available by choosing <font size="-1"><u>(Character                 Matrix) Matrix&gt;Edit State Names</u></font>, allows you to name                 the states of categorical characters.

You                 can change the orientation (states by characters, or characters                 by states) of the State Names Editor by touching the double arrow                 at the top left of the window. Footnotes can be attached to particular                 states by selecting the state and typing the footnote in the annotation                 area at the bottom of the window.               <h3><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a name="annotations"></a>Annotations</font></h3>              <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">You can annotate the character matrix                 by attaching simple footnotes, more elaborate annotations, or                 colors to the taxa, characters or cells of the matrix.

You can search                 for annotations containing text using the Find Annotation menu                 item of the Annotations submenu. </p>              <h3><a name="coloring"></a>Coloring cells of the matrix</h3>              <p>Cells or their text can be <strong>colored</strong>. The default                 background cell color is chosen in the <u><font size="-1">(Character                 Matrix) Matrix&gt;Background Color</font></u> submenu. Colors                 to distinguish different cells can be specified using the items                 in the <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                 Matrix) Matrix&gt;Color Cells</font></u> and <u><font size="-1">(Character                 Matrix) Matrix&gt;Color Text</font></u> submenus. These submenus                 specify the color to be used for the background of the cell, or                 for the text within the cell, according to the following criteria:               <p>               <ul>                <li>Character value &#8212; A cell is colored according to a value                   for the entire character, such as parsimony character steps.</li>                <li>Cell value &#8212; A cell is colored according to a value                   for that particular cell. For instance, with DNA sequence data,                   the cells can be colored blue if the site is G or C, white if                   A or T. By selecting <u>(Character Matrix) Matrix&gt;Moving                   Window (for colors)...</u>, you can set the size of the moving                   window over which GC content is averaged. Other cell values                   are available for amino acid properties (e.g., hydrophobicity)</li>                <li>Excluded &#8212; A cell is colored gray if its character is                   excluded.</li>                <li>Footnote present&#8212; A cell is colored green if it has                   a footnote.</li>                <li>Character State &#8212; A cell is colored according to the                   character state (e.g. different colors for A, C, G, T)</li>                <li>Annotation attached &#8212; A cell is colored green if annotation                   (not footnotes, but the full complex annotations) are attached                   to it.</li>                <li>Assigned Colors &#8212; A cell is shown with color as assigned                   by the paintbrush tool (<img src="images/treeTools/colorBranch.gif" width="26" height="26">).                   To assign a color to a cell, click on the cell with the paintbrush.                   Touch and hold the button in the tool palette to obtain a menu                   to select the color used, remove colors or color all selected                   cells. </li>              </ul>              <p>When cells are colored, you may request a legend for the colors                 by selecting <strong>Show Color Legend</strong> in the Matrix                 menu, or by touching the small button(<img src="images/colorLegend.gif" width="16" height="12">)                 at lower left of the Matrix Editor (beneath the taxon names).                 If you double click on a color in the matrix, the editor will                 move to a cell with that color.               <p>               <h3><a name="alter"></a>Alterations and Transformations</h3>              <p>The following are available in the Alter/Transform menu of the                 Matrix menu to modify the cells of a matrix:               <p>               <ul>                <li>Filling selected cells with a specified state: Choose <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                   Matrix) Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform&gt;Fill</font></u></li>                <li>Filling selected cells with random states with equal frequency                   for all states: Choose <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                   Matrix) Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform&gt;Random Fill</font></u></li>                <li>Randomly reshuffle the states within a character among the                   selected taxa: Choose <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                   Matrix) Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform&gt;Other Choices...&gt;Shuffle                   states among taxa</font></u></li>                <li>For nucleotide sequence data, convert the entries in each                   cell into their complement: Choose <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                   Matrix) Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform&gt;Other Choices...&gt;Nucleotide                   complement</font></u></li>                <li>Reversing a selected molecular sequence: Choose <u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Character                   Matrix) Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform&gt;Other Choices...&gt;Reverse                   Sequence</font></u></li>              </ul>              <h3><a name="changing"></a>Changing the attributes of characters</h3>              <p>A character, in addition to having states assigned in each of                 the terminal taxa, may also have other attributes. For instance,                 a character is marked as included or excluded, and it has assumptions                 attributed to it, such as a weight and a parsimony model of evolution.                 These attributes are used in various calculations. They may be                 assigned in the List of Characters windows, available in the Characters                 menu.               <p align="center"><img src="images/charList.jpg" width="428" height="306">               <p>In the List of Characters window, columns refer to inclusion,                 parsimony model and probability model (for likelihood calculations).                 Other columns can be requested for Group Membership, Weight, and                 (for DNA data) Codon Position. You can ask to show a column using                 the Columns menu. For each of these columns, the assigned attribute                 can be changed by first either selecting the characters to be                 changed (if only some characters are to be altered) or selecting                 the attribute's column (if all characters are to be altered).                 Then, by touching the name of the column (where an inverted black                 triangle should appear), a <strong>drop down menu</strong> appears                 that allows you to make the appropriate specification.               <p>For each of the attributes other than group membership, the bottom                 three menu items are to store to the file the current specification                 as a named specification set (like saving a typeset or weightset                 in MacClade), to replace an existing specification set with the                 current one, or to load a stored specification set to become the                 current.               <p>The following are the options specific to each column:               <ul>                <li>Inclusion - Include, Exclude, and Reverse allow you to change                   character inclusion. Reverse changes excluded to included and                   vice versa. Characters that are excluded don't participate in                   treelength and many other calculations. Exclusion is not universally                   respected by the calculations, for some calculations use even                   characters that are excluded.                 <li>Parsimony model - The Model submenu allows you to select a                   parsimony model to assign to the characters, for use in parsimony                   calculations.                 <li>Probability model - The Model submenu allows you to select                   a probability model to assign to the characters, for use in                   likelihood calculations and simulations.                 <li><a name="groups"></a>Group Membership - The image above shows                   Group Membership in the last column. To assign characters to                   groups, you must first create groups using New Group. For instance,                   you could create a group Adult Characters and another group                   Larval Characters. Then, you can assign character to the group                   using the Set Group submenu. You can also edit the color of                   the group, and rename the group. The group color is useful to                   distinguish characters of different groups, for instance in                   charts or in the Character Matrix editor.                 <li>Weight - With the Set weight menu item you can set the weight                   assigned to the character. This is used currently on in treelength                   calculations.                 <li>Codon Positions &#8212; This column is available for DNA data.                   The drop down menu allows you to assign positions.               </ul>              <h3><a name="charting"></a>Charting information about Characters</h3>              <p>Informative statistics and values for characters can be viewed                 or <a href="charts.html">charted</a> in various windows. In the                 Analysis menu a <strong>Bar &amp; Line Chart</strong> can be requested                 to show the distribution of a value for a series of characters.                 For instance, the number of parsimony steps in the characters                 on a current tree can be charted. The <strong>Scattergram</strong>                 available in the Analysis menu plots characters in a two dimensional                 space with the X axis being one particular value (e.g., the character's                 likelhood under one tree), the Y axis another value (e.g. the                 character's likelihood under a different tree). Values for characters                 can also be viewed in the <strong>List of Characters</strong>                 window, where columns can be added (in the List menu) to show                 selected statistics for each of the characters. <!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>          </tr>        </table>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="100%">          <tr>             <td align="left" valign="top">               <hr>              <p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span class="smallplain"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org"><font size="2">Mesquite              Home Page</font></a><font size="2"> | <a href="manual.html">Mesquite              Manual</a></font></span></font></p>              <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span class="smallplain">Copyright                 &copy; 2002-2007 by <a href="http://salticidae.org/wpm/home.html">Wayne                 P.
