Consensus Tree
	snaphshots?
	WAYNE: truly incremental with TreesDirectlyFromFile
	WAYNE: if two tree blocks, and do ConsensusTrees>Stored Tree Blocks, doesn't query for which block
	better storage for maj rule values on branches
	for majrule, cycle get whole bipartition vector for each tree and compare all at once?
	order bipartition vector based upon first integer in bits


Add AverageStandardDeviation of split frequencies method to BipartitionVector




===========
Our code, using Bits

Bembidion 545 trees
	majrule:  1.641 seconds
	strict:  1.567 seconds

100RandomTrees (200 taxa)
	majrule: 33.002 seconds
	strict: 0.312 seconds
