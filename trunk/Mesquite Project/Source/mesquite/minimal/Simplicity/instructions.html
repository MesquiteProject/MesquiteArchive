<h3>Simple vs. Full Interface</h3>

<p>To use Mesquite's full interface with all menu items and buttons, choose <strong>Full Interface</strong> in the panel above or in the info bars at the top of most windows.</p>
<p>To configure what is hidden when you choose the simple mode, hit the button <strong>Turn ON Editing Mode</strong> in the panel above. For instructions of how to use the Editing Mode, see below. </p>

<h3>What is hidden in Simple mode?</h3>
A menu item or tool is hidden if it has been specifically chosen to be hidden, or if the Mesquite package that controls it has been hidden.
<p>To <strong>hide all the menu items and tools belonging to a Mesquite package or module</strong>, uncheck its box in the Simplify Control Panel here. The list of packages and modules to be hidden can be accessed only when in Editing Mode. To edit this list, Turn ON Editing mode by hitting the button above, but then you'll have to turn it off again to continue reading here.</p>
<p>To <strong>hide a single menu item or tool</strong>, select it when Editing Mode is on.  In Editing Mode, when you select menu items or tools, they will be highlighted to show they will be hidden. Hidden menu items will be marked with &quot;(OFF)&quot; if you have chosen that particular item to hide, &quot;(PACKAGE OFF)&quot; if the item will be hidden because its package has been hidden.  Hidden tools will be ringed in <font color = "#FF0000"><strong>red</strong></font> if you have chosen that particular item to hide, in <font color = "#0000FF"><strong>blue</strong></font> if hidden because its package has been hidden. </p>
<p>After you have edited what you want to hide, hit the button above &quot;Turn OFF Editing Mode&quot;. Then, choose &quot;Simple Interface&quot;  to show the simplified interface.</p>
<h3>Saving and loading simplifications</h3>
You can save your current set of choices for hiding packages, menu items and tools by selecting <strong>Save Current Simplification</strong>  in the drop down menu labeled Save/Load in the Simplify Control Panel above.
<p>You can load pre-existing settings for simplifications by selecting items from the <strong>Load Simplification</strong> submenu of the same drop down menu. </p>
<p>The pre-existing simplifications are stored in <strong>Mesquite_Folder/settings/mesquite/minimal/Simplify</strong>. If you want to customize and store your own simplification among the pre-existing ones, copy Simplification.xml from Mesquite_Support_Files/Mesquite_Prefs into <strong>Mesquite_Folder/settings/mesquite/minimal/Simplify</strong>. You can rename this file, and you can also go into the file with a text editor and change &quot;&lt;name&gt;Custom&lt;/name&gt;&quot; to a name your prefer, for example &quot;&lt;name&gt;For Students&lt;/name&gt;&quot;.</p>
