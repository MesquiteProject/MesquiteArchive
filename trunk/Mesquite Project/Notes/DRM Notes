David to do

1.07 to fix:
mesquite.genesis.SimDNAMatrixEmpirBased.SimDNAMatrixEmpirBased
mesquite.trees.NumForNodesWithChar.NumForNodesWithChar
mesquite.trees.NumForNodesWithCharHist.NumForNodesWithCharHist
mesquite.trees.NumForNodesWithMat.NumForNodesWithMat
mesquite.trees.NumsForNodesBrLengths.NumsForNodesBrLengths
mesquite.align.AlignToDropped.AlignToDropped





=====================
1.11:
	- undo in editor!
	- work on SimDNAMatrixEmpirBased
	- change CellColorer so that setActiveColors returns a boolean as 
		to whether it is successful or not

1.2:
	-rework charting code completely

- get consensus trees in Mesquite

- Distance

******************************
notes from Wayne:  
--should we try to move taxon symbols menu items in Tree menu to Drawing menu? 
--transparency not yet working with taxon names in matrix
	transparency problems in matrix

Histogram
	- make sure cumulative code fits for disabling/enabling
	- bug with end point
	
Live charts with double buffering of drawing

tolweb.org as CIPRes service (Danny)

database connectivity in general

view of live data matrix

adding concentrated changes

Chromaseq


NECESSARY
	18S example sequence panels don't line up
	option to check for double peaks in read touched, and move these to matrix sequence
	
	fading of base letters for each read as an option
	deselect if touched
	dealing with selection outside the bounds of the matrix
	
	accumulating sequences into project
	
	store preferences
	

- ability to edit sequences OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS of sequence in the matrix.  
	E.g., if you want to "untrim" the sequences and add 30 base calls to the start.
- associated with this would be a "Move To Matrix" command that would let one move 
	the calls made in a particular read to be the ones made in the matrix.  
	This is needed because of the excess trimming of single-read regions made by Phred Phrap.

LATER
show codon positions
select to end with keystroke
magnify tool
smoothing of peaks

nice views for printing.
amplification bar for each sequence

Cartographer

	- add map path and other details (including projection type) to XML file

post version 1:
	- coloring of list cells
