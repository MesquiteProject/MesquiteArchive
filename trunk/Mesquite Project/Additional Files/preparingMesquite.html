In the workspace, you should find several folders.  One is called Mesquite Project; this is the core of Mesquite.  The other   folders are for other Mesquite packages.  </li>  <li>In Mesquite Project, you will find a &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot;.      Copy that entire folder to another location on your hard disk.  This is the Mesquite_Folder that will be able to be moved to another machine.  That copy will henceforth be referred to as   the Mesquite_Folder Copy</li>  <li>Also in the workspace are the folders for project for other packages.      For example, one is Chromaseq. To add Chromaseq to Mesquite_Folder Copy, open the Chromaseq folder. Inside that you will find a &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot;;      open that, then &quot;mesquite&quot;. In there you will find a folder called &quot;chromaseq&quot;.  Copy that folder into the &quot;mesquite&quot; folder within Mesquite_Folder Copy.</li>  <li>Repeat #3 for any of the other projects you wish to incorporate.</li>  <li>Go into the copy of the Mesquite_Folder Copy you made in step 2, and  delete any files whose names start with &quot;classpath&quot;. </li>	<li>Open up Mesquite_Folder Copy and start up the copy of Mesquite in there.	  If it starts up without errors, you should be fine. If, however, there	  are errors, then it might be because the &quot;jars&quot; folder is not fully set	  up (this is a problem we haven't managed to get a regular fix for). You	  should then try the following:	  <ul>	    <li>go into Mesquite Project/Additional Files and copy from there the jars.zip	      file into Mesquite Project/Mesquite_Folder</li>        <li>delete the jars folder present in Mesquite Project/Mesquite_Folder</li>	    <li>unzip the jars.zip folder in Mesquite Project/Mesquite_Folder</li>        <li>Start up Mesquite again to see if the problems are now fixed; if          there are still problems, please contact David Maddison.</li>      </ul>	</li>    <li>If all is well, then zip the Mesquite_Folder copy and you can now move      it onto another machine.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
