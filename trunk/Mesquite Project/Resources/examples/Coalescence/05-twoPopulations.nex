	TEXT  FILE TEXT = 'Coalescence simulations can be blended with associations between containing and contained trees by simulating gene trees within a species tree.  In this file, the species tree is actually a population tree, and there are only two populations.^n^nThere are two sets of taxa, one representing populations (East and West) and the other representing genes sampled from those populations.  At left is a population tree within which is simulated a gene tree by coalescence.  The time since the populations split was 50 generations; the effective population size is 100 (you can change time divergence as described below; change Ne using the menu item in the Contained menu of the tree window).  Scroll through simulated gene trees by hitting the arrows under "Contained Tree" in the legend.^n^nThe degree to which the gene tree is expected to show a clean separation of genes sampled in the West from those sampled in the East depends on the time since separation of the populations.  To increase the time since separation of the populations, change the branch lengths of the species tree.  Do this in one of two ways: (1) use the ruler tool (to change both branches at once, select both branches using the branch select tool, holding down the shift key as you are selecting the second branch to accumulate the selection.  Then, once both branches are selected, apply the ruler tool to one of them), or (2) select "Set all branch lengths" from the "Branch lengths" submenu of the Tree menu of the tree window.^n^nNote that the longer are the branch lengths, the more completely the genes in each population have coalesced before they reach the ancestral populations.  You can see this clearly in the tree window showing a gene tree by itself.  Because there is a TaxaPartition stored in the data file that indicates the West samples are to be colored tan and the East samples to be colored green, their names in the gene tree window are colored accordingly.  This gene tree is simulated, and as you change the lengths of the branches of the population tree, you may see a change in the degree of mixing of the East and West samples in the gene tree.^n^nTo go to the next example, hit the button in the "Go To File" window at left.^n^nTo duplicate this file, create a file with two sets of taxa and an association block indicating how they are linked.  Ask to show a tree window for the populations.  Select "Contained Associates" for the tree form, selecting Simulate Tree and Contained Coalescence for the tree source.  Ask to show branch lengths.';
