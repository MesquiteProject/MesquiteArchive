              <h3><a name="simulations"></a>Simulations</h3>
              <p>Trees can be created through simulations of speciation and extinction. 
                Here are options:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tree simulators available to make tree blocks (<font size="-1"><u>Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;Make 
                  New Trees Block from&gt;Simulated Trees</u></font>) or to generate 
                  trees on demand (e.g., for charts or in the tree window). 
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uniform speciation (Yule)</strong> (trees package) 
                      - Generates tree by a pure birth process (a Yule process). 
                      The chance of speciation is equal for all tips. Options: 
                      total time depth of tree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uniform speciation with sampling</strong> (TreeFarm 
                      package) &#8212; Generates a tree by Yule process, as above, 
                      but with to a total number of species greater than in the 
                      taxa block. Extra species are then randomly sampled out, 
                      to leave the tree with the appropriate number of species. 
                      Barraclough &amp; Nee (2001) discuss how this sampling alters 
                      the branch length distribution of the tree. </li>
                    <li><strong>Birth/Death process trees</strong> (Diverse package) 
                      &#8212; Generates trees with a speciation rate and extinction 
                      rate.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trees &amp; Diversification Characters</strong> (Diverse 
                  package) &#8212; Simulates speciation and extinction, simultaneous 
                  with the evolution of characters that influence speciation and 
                  extinction rates. Select the Trees &amp; Diversification Characters 
                  item in the Taxa&amp;Trees menu to generate the tree block and 
                  a character matrix; the i'th tree was evolved in connection 
                  with the i'th character in the matrix. 
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>BiSSE Trees &amp; Characters</strong> &#8212; 
                      by this model, a categorical character evolves with two 
                      states, which can cause their lineages to differ in their 
                      speciation rates, and in their extinction rates. You will 
                      be given the following options for setting up the simulation:<br>
                      <img src="BiSSESimParams.gif"><br>
                      The rates of character change, speciation and extinction 
                      represent the 6 parameters of the BiSSE model. The <strong>Desired 
                      Tree Size</strong> is the number of terminal taxa in the 
                      trees you want to produce. By default this is the current 
                      number of taxa in the data file, but you could choose a 
                      number either higher or lower. The &quot;<strong>Continue 
                      to Tree Size</strong>&quot; option is explained as follows. 
                      The algorithm starts speciation and extinction and eventually 
                      the desired tree size is reached. However, it doesn't stop 
                      there, because if the simulation were continued, that desired 
                      tree size might be achieved several times (fluctating as 
                      speciation and extinction push the number of species up 
                      and down). The simulation continues until the size indicated 
                      in &quot;Continue to Tree Size&quot;, which should be larger 
                      than the desired size. The simulation goes to that tree 
                      size and then looks back at all of the intermediate steps 
                      in which a tree of the desired number of taxa was achieve. 
                      It then selects one of these trees randomly. (NOTE: the 
                      simulation used in this module differs from that used by 
                      Maddison, Midford and Otto, 2007, who used a prerelease 
                      version of the module. Their simulation proceeded in small 
                      time slices, and stopped as soon as the desired tree size 
                      was reached. The released version samples exponential wait 
                      times to jump to the next event, and proceeds beyond the 
                      desired tree size as described above.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Evolving Speciation Rate (continuous character)</strong> 
                      &#8212; This is a speciation-only model. A continuous character 
                      evolves by Brownian motion; this character is the speciation 
                      rate. There is no extinction.</li>

              <h3><a name="ltt"></a>Lineages through Time</h3>
              <p>You can display a lineages through time plot of the current tree 
                in the tree window by selecting the <u><font size="-1">(Tree Window)Analysis&gt;Lineages

              <h3><a name="speciationextinction"></a>Analysis: Speciation/Extinction 
                rates (Independent of character)</h3>
              <p>This analysis assumes that speciation and extinction rates are 
                constant (they do not depend on any character). The calculation 
                is available in the Analysis menu of a tree window, under <strong>Diversification 
                (Char. Indep.).</strong> The calculation is also available anywhere 
                that a value for a tree can be calculated, for instance in the 
                Tree Legend of the tree window (under Analysis), in the List of 
                Trees (Columns&gt;Number For Tree&gt;Other Choices), and in a 
                Trees chart. </p>
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Speciation/Extinction Likelihood</strong> - This calculates 
                  the likelihood of a simple birth/death model with a speciation 
                  rate and an extinction rate, using a reduced form of the BiSSE 
                  calculations of Maddison, Midford &amp; Otto 2007. If the rates 
                  are not indicated (i.e. are indicated as ?), then they are estimated.</li>
              </ul></p>
              <h3><a name="divCharDep"></a>Analysis: A binary character's effect 
                on diversification</h3>
              <p>These analyses explore whether there is an association between 
                the states of a characters, and the rates of speciation and extinction. 
                These analyseis are available in the Analysis menu of a tree window, 
                under <strong>Character-Associated Diversification</strong>. They 
                are also anywhere that a value for a tree can be calculated, for 
                instance in the tree legend of the tree window (Analysis&gt;Tree 
                Legend&gt;Tree Value Using Character, Show secondary choices), 
                in the List of Trees (Columns&gt;Number for Tree&gt;Tree Value 
                Using Character, Show secondary choices), and in charts of trees. 
                They are also available in the List of Characters window (Columns&gt;Number 
                For Character&gt;Character Value with Current Tree, Show secondary 
                choices) and in charts of characters.</p>
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li><strong>BiSSE Speciation/Extinction Likelihood</strong> (Maddison, 
                  Midford &amp; Otto, 2007) &#8212; This calculates likelihoods 
                  and estimates parameters of a 6 parameter model of speciation, 
                  extinction and character change. The parameters are speciation 
                  rate under state 0 (lambda0), speceation rate under state 1 
                  (lambda1), extinction rate under state 0 (mu0), extinction rate 
                  under state 1 (mu1), rate of 0 to 1 character change (q01), 
                  and rate of 1 to 0 character change (q10). In the parameters 
                  dialog box you can set the parameter values (or leave them &quot;?&quot;, 
                  to be estimated), and you can constrain some to be equal to 
                  others. </li>
                <li><strong>BiSSE Net Diversification Likelihood</strong> &#8212; 
                  This is basically the same calculation as the BiSSE speciation/extinction 
                  likelihood, but is reparameterized as net diversification rate 
                  under state 0 (r0, which is lambda0-mu0), under state 1 (r1), 
                  speciation/extinction ratio under state 0 (a0, which is lambda0/mu0), 
                  under state 1 (a1), and the two character state change rates. 
                  It is reparameterized to permit you to set constraints of equality 
                  that would otherwise be unavailable.</li>
                <li><strong>Sister Diversification</strong> &#8212; This uses 
                  the simple sign test on independent sister clade pairs in the 
                  style of Mitter, Farrell and Wiegmann 1988. The analysis automatically 
                  finds sister clade pairs that contrast in the character state 
                  of the binary character. Each clade must be completely uniform 
                  in state. The number of pairs favoring state 1 (i.e. the clade 
                  with state 1 is larger) and favoring state 0 are counted and 
                  used as the basis for the sign test.</li>

              <h4><a name="bisseCalculations"></a>The BiSSE likelihood calculations</h4>
              <p>The Diverse package's BiSSE calculations are based on the equations 
                of Maddison, Midford &amp; Otto (2007). The maximum likelihood 
                calculations are performed using the optimizer of Brent (1973). 
                To improve the performance of the optimizer, the BiSSE module 
                invokes the optimizer from 10 randomly selected starting points. 
                During these runs, the numerical integrator (see below) is set 
                to run with a relatively large starting step size equal to 1/100 
                the length of an average branch. This length is value is allowed 
                to vary somewhat (a range of 8:1) with the length of the particular 
                branch, so that extremely short branches and long branches are 
                not undercounted or overcounted respectively. The final likelihood 
                value is then calculated using the starting point with the best 
                likelihood, but a smaller step size (1/1000) the average branch 
                length.</p>
              <p> The BiSSE method requires numerical solution of a system of 
                four differential equations along each branch of the tree. To 
                do this, Diverse uses a RKF45 (Runge-Kutta-Fehlenberg fourth order 
                method with fifth order step-size control) algorithm to integrate 
                along the branches. The step-size control allows the step size 
                to vary from the starting value based on the correction calculation. 
                Because BiSSE equations are relatively well behaved, using a higher 
                order correction mostly serves to speed the calculation by allowing 
                the method to grow the step size. Note that this method is a refinement 
                of the RK4 algorithm used in Maddison, Midford &amp; Otto (2007).</p>
              <h4><a name="ht"></a>Hypothesis Testing</h4>
              <p>To test hypotheses about the association between a character 
                and diversification rates, you can use either the Sister Diversification 
                calculation, which directly gives a P value, or the BiSSE Ln Likelihood 
                Difference calculation, which can be used to get a p value. The 
                former is an old but fairly non-parametric calculation; the latter 
                is parametric but uses more of the information in the tree. </p>
              <p>The BiSSE Ln Likelihood Difference calculation is used for likelihood 
                ratio tests. It performing the calculations in constrained and 
                unconstrained ways and calculating the difference in likelihood. 
                You can access these calculations as a choice when you do the 
                Character-Associated Diversification analysis in the Analysis 
                menu of the Tree window, or in other places (such as charts) where 
                you are calculating a value for a tree and character. You will 
                be asked first to specify the parameters of the unconstrained 
                model, then the parameters of the constrained model. </p>
              <p>The likelihood difference can be used to answer whether, for 
                instance, two parameter values are the same. Thus, the constrained 
                model would set them equal (using the &quot;Constrain =&quot; 
                choices in the dialog), while the unconstrained model would not 
                include this constraint. When there is a difference of a single 
                degree of freedom in the constrained and unconstrained models 
                (i.e. comparing a five parameter and a 6 parameter model) then 
                two times the likelihood difference appears to be approximately 
                distributed as a chi square (Maddison, Midford &amp; Otto 2007), 
                so that you can use that distribution for significance values. 
              </p>
              <p>It is more accurate, but more time consuming, to simulate under 
                the null model to derive your own distribution for statistical 
                testing. You can do this as follows.</p>
              <p> 
              <ol>
                <li>With your data, estimate the values of the BiSSE parameters 
                  in the <strong>constrained</strong> case (e.g., lambda0 = lambda1). 
                </li>
                <li>Simulate trees and characters using Trees &amp; Diversification 
                  Characters in the Taxa&amp;Trees menu, choosing the BiSSE Trees 
                  &amp; Characters as the simulator. Enter the parameters as you 
                  had estimated them from your data. Choose as many taxa as in 
                  your data. You might want to simulate a small number of trees, 
                  e.g. 5, at first, just to practice with these calculations. 
                  (Later increase the sample size to a large number, e.g. 1000, 
                  to derive a good distribution.)</li>
                <li>Save the file (just in case).</li>
                <li>Choose New Bar &amp; Line Chart for... Characters. You will 
                  be asked a series of question. Here are the responses: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Source of Characters: Stored characters. If given a choice, 
                      make sure you choose the matrix you just simulated with 
                      BiSSE Trees &amp; Characters.</li>
                    <li> Value (under secondary choices): Character value with 
                      respective tree</li>
                    <li>Source of trees: Stored trees. If given a choice, make 
                      sure you choose the trees you just simulated with BiSSE 
                      Tree &amp; Characters.</li>
                    <li>Value: BiSSE Ln likelihood difference</li>
                    <li>BiSSE Parameters: Leave the parameters unspecified, but 
                      set the constraints to be as in your <strong>UNCONSTRAINED</strong> 
                      model.</li>
                    <li>BiSSE Parameters: Leave the parameters unspecified, but 
                      set the constraints to be as in your <strong>CONSTRAINED</strong> 
                      model.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This calculation may take a long time. If asked, indicate 
                  you want to save a table of results. Also, print the chart and 
                  save it as text once it's done. You might not want to redo it 
                  (as it takes a while).</li>
              </ol></p>
              <h4><a name="mt"></a>Multiple Trees</h4>
              <p>You can examine likelihoods, or other single parameters from 
                the BiSSE modules, over multiple trees by asking for a tree chart 
                and indicating you want a Tree Value using Character. You will 
                be asked if you want to save the results as a table to a text 
                file during the calculations; this text file will contain all 
                of the parameter values as well, as a tab-delimited table, so 
                that you can import it into a spreadsheet program.</p>
              <p>You can also examine multiple trees by setting up the tree window 
                and selecting Character-Associated Diversification in the Analysis 
                menu to begin a BiSSE calculation. Then, you can paste the following 
                script into the Send Script dialog box (available in the Tree 
                window's Window menu, Scripting submenu). This script will go 
                from tree to tree, saving results as it goes.</p>
