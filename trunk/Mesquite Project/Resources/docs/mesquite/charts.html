items, whether taxa, trees, characters, or matrices. Mesquite                 has two primary styles of charts: </p>              <ul>                <li><strong>Bar &amp; Line Charts</strong> - a bar or linechart                   summarizing values for each of many objects; includes histograms                   to show frequencies of values. (Called &quot;Histogram&quot;                   in earlier versions of Mesquite.)</li>                <li><strong>Scattergram</strong> - a plot showing each object's                   value in two variables</li>              </ul>              <p>Most of Mesquite's charts are available through the first few                 submenus of the Analysis menu. </p>              <p>We suspect the greatest challenge to the user will be learning                 what chart to choose and how to set it up. For instance, how can                 one create a chart summarizing the estimated rate of a character's                 evolution according to each of a series of trees? Does one choose                 <u><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New Bar                 &amp; Line Chart For&gt;Characters</font></u> because the value                 concerns a character? No, one chooses <u><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New                 Bar &amp; Line Chart For&gt;Trees</font></u> because the numerous                 objects being summarized are trees, as the question concerns just                 one character but many trees. For each tree, what is being calculated                 is a value that relates to a character.</p>              <h4>Contents</h4>              <ul>                <li><a href="#wizard">Chart Wizard</a></li>                <li><a href="#selection">Selection of objects in charts</a></li>                <li><a href="#recalc">Auto-recalculation</a></li>                <li><a href="#histograms">Bar &amp; Line Charts</a>                   <ul>                    <li>Example: <a href="#robustness">Robustness of estimated                       bias in character evolution</a></li>                    <li>Example: <a href="#gcbias">Compositional bias along a                       sequence</a></li>                    <li><a href="#optionsH">Calculating and formatting options</a></li>                  </ul>                </li>                <li><a href="#scattergrams">Scattergrams</a>                   <ul>                    <li>Example: <a href="#cva">Canonical Variates Analysis</a></li>                    <li>Example: <a href="#varhydrophob">Correlation between variability                       and hydrophobicity</a> </li>                    <li><a href="#optionsS">Calculating and formatting options                       </a></li>                  </ul>                </li>              </ul>              <h3><a name="wizard"></a>Chart Wizard</h3>              <p>The first item in the Analysis window, Chart Wizard, helps you                 make charts. It asks you a series of questions to determine what                 type of chart you want. We provide this because it is sometimes                 difficult to decide how to start building a chart. Alternatively,                 you can use the <u><font size="-1">New Bar &amp; Line Chart for</font></u>                 and <u><font size="-1">New Scattergram for</font></u> submenus                 to build a chart.</p>              <h3><a name="selection"></a>Selection of objects in charts</h3>              <font face="Trebuchet MS">               <p>Most bar &amp; line charts and scattergrams depict the values                 of objects&#8212; characters, taxa, trees &#8212; that can be                 selected. If you select these objects elsewhere in Mesquite, for                 example by selecting a column (character) in the Character Matrix                 Editor, then this selected objects will be highlighted in the                 chart. You can select the objects directly in the chart by clicking                 and dragging with the arrow cursor.               <p>When objects are selected in the chart, and Copy is selected,                 then a list of the selected data points is copied to the clipboard.                 Otherwise if no objects are selected, then Copy puts the list                 of all data points into the clipboard. </font>               <h3><a name="recalc"></a>Auto-recalculation</h3>              <p>By default, charts are recalculated whenever Mesquite detects                 that the data or assumptions underlying the chart have changed.                 If the chart calculation takes a long time, then this can lead                 to many delays if you need to make many changes in the data or                 assumptions. You can temporarily turn off the automatic chart                 recalculation by deselecting the Auto-recalculate menu item in                 the Chart or Scattergram menu. You can also request to Force Recalculation                 in the Chart menu.</p>              <h3><a name="histograms"></a>Bar &amp; Line Charts</h3>              <p>The bar &amp; line charts available via the Analysis menu are:</p>              <ul>                <li><strong>Characters</strong> &#8212; the items whose values                   are summarized are characters.

This is particularly useful                     for some calculations that result in more than just a single                     value per item charted; in this case you will be asked when                     you start the chart whether you want to save the record.</li>                </ul>              </p>              <h4>Examples </h4>              <p><strong><a name="robustness"></a>Robustness of estimated bias                 in character evolution</strong> &#8212; Suppose a biologist estimated                 the bias in the rates of gains versus losses in a character's                 evolution on a given tree. How might the estimate depend on accuracy                 of the tree's branch lengths? To answer this, one could see how                 the estimate varies when noise is added to the branch lengths                 of the given tree. First have a tree window available with the                 given tree showing. Then:               <ul>                <li>Select the menu item <u><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analysis&gt;New                   Bar &amp; Line Chart For&gt;Trees</font></u></li>                <li>A dialog box with heading &quot;Source of trees (Trees chart)&quot;                   should appear.

Choose <strong>Tree Value using character</strong>,                   because the desired value depends on the tree and a character.</li>                <li>In the dialog box &quot;Value to calculate for tree with character&quot;,                   ask to show secondary choices then choose <strong>Forward/Backward                   rates</strong></li>                <li>In the dialog box &quot;Source of characters (for Forward/Backward                   rates)&quot;, choose <strong>Stored Characters</strong> (presuming                   you already have your character of interest entered in a data                   matrix).</li>                <li>You may be asked other questions, depending on whether you                   data file includes multiple matrices.

For some scattergrams, a choice is given as to whether                 the <strong>Same</strong> or <strong>Different</strong> calculations                 should be shown on the two axes. By &quot;Same&quot; is meant                 that the same calculation is done but with a different parameter                 value. For instance, if the scattegram is a Taxa scattergram,                 it could show the character state in continuous character 1 on                 the Y axis, and the state in character 2 on the X axis. These                 represent the same calculation (continuous character state value),                 differing only in the character used. By &quot;Different&quot;                 is meant an entirely different calculation, such as the asymmetry                 of a tree on the Y axis and its likelihood score for a character                 on the X axis.</p>              <h4>Examples</h4>              <p><a name="cva"></a><strong>Canonical Variates Analysis</strong>                 &#8212; For a sample of specimens measured for a series of variables,                 how can the measurements be combined to best distinguish predefined                 groups?
