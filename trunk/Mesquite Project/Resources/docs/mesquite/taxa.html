entities in Mesquite: they represent                 the species or gene copies whose characteristics are recorded                 in character matrices, whose relationships are summarized in trees.                 Our use of the word &quot;taxa&quot; isn't the traditional one,                 which views a taxon as a formally recognized group at any level                 (e.g., genus, family, order) in a taxonomic classification. Rather,                 as with other computer programs, Mesquite uses &quot;taxon&quot;                 as a shorthand for &quot;terminal taxon&quot; (the smallest unit                 of analysis of relationships, equivalent to &quot;Operational                 Taxonomic Unit&quot; or &quot;Evolutionary Unit&quot;). Higher                 level groups are refered to as clades.</p>              <p>Taxa in Mesquite currently must belong to taxa blocks, which                 are collections of taxa. Thus, the taxon &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;                 would belong to a taxa block, for instance one called &quot;Mammalia&quot;                 which may also contain other taxa such as &quot;Mus musculus&quot;                 and &quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;.</p>              <h3> <a name="creating"></a>Creating and managing taxa blocks</h3>              <p>To add taxa to a data file, a taxa block must first be created                 to contain them. Mesquite automatically asks you to create a taxa                 block when you make a new file. You can later create a new taxa                 block by selecting <font size="-1"><u>Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;New Block                 of Taxa...</u></font> A dialog box will ask you the name of the                 taxa block and the initial number of taxa (you can add or delete                 taxa later). You will be then shown the List of Taxa window, in                 which you can rename the taxa (you can also rename them in the                 Character Matrix Editor).</p>              <p>Mesquite allows more than one taxa block to exist in a file.                 Thus, there is a List of Taxa Blocks window which shows you all                 of the taxa blocks defined. To rename a taxa block, edit its name                 directly in tis window. To delete a taxa block, select its row                 in this window and choose <font size="-1"><u>List&gt;Delete Selected                 Taxa Blocks</u></font>. Deleting a taxa block may cause character                 matrices and tree blocks that depend on it to be deleted.</p>              <h3> <a name="managing"></a>Managing taxa</h3>              <p>You can add and delete taxa in the List of Taxa window and in                 the Character Matrix editor. In the List of Taxa window, taxa                 can be added by selecting <font size="-1"><u>List&gt;Add Taxa...</u></font>.                 In the Character Matrix Editor, taxa can be added either by using                 the Add Taxa tool or by selecting <font size="-1"><u>Matrix&gt;Add                 Taxa...</u></font> </p>              <p>Taxa can be deleted in the List of Taxa window by selecting their                 rows and choosing <font size="-1"><u>List&gt;Delete Selected Taxa</u></font>.                 Taxa can be deleted in the Character Matrix Editor by selecting                 their rows and choosing <u> <font size="-1">Matrix&gt;Delete Selected</font></u>.</p>              <p>Taxa can be renamed by editing their names directly in the List                 of Taxa window or in the Character Matrix editor, or by using                 the Name tool in the Tree Window.</p>              <p>To change the order of taxa, you can select and drag entire taxa                 in the List of Taxa Window or the Character Matrix Editor. You                 can also us the sort tool (<img src="images/sortTool.gif" width="26" height="26" align="middle">)                 to sort taxa automatically in alphabetical or numerical order                 of the column on which you touch in these windows. </p>              <p>Taxa can be merged, with their character states merged, using                 <a href="characters.html#mergetaxa">Merge Taxa</a> of the Taxon                 Utilities submenu.</p>              <p>Different blocks of taxa can be merged during <a href="molecular/molecular.html#includetaxafromfile">file                 import</a> or <a href="molecular/molecular.html#fusedMatrices">file                 export</a>. Otherwise there are not yet methods to merge taxa                 blocks within Mesquite.</p>              <h3><a name="renamingtaxa"></a>Renaming taxa</h3>              <p>Taxa can be renamed by editing their names directly in the List                 of Taxa window or in the Character Matrix editor, or by using                 the Name tool in the Tree Window.</p>              <p>In the List of Taxa window and Character Matrix Editor, the Taxon                 Names submenu permits you to make changes to taxon names. <strong>Condense                 Taxon Names</strong>, for instance, assigns shorter names with                 punctuation removed. This may be useful for converting names to                 a format for other programs.</p>              <h3><a name="alternativeNames"></a>Alternative Taxon Names</h3>              <p>This feature allows you to have several alternative naming schemes                 for taxa, e.g. one set of names that includes your specimen codes,                 another set that uses formal taxonomic names (for publication),                 another set whose names are condensed for exporting to programs                 that can handle only short names, and so on. By switching among                 naming schemes, you can change how your trees appear, what tree                 files you can read in, and so forth. (Prior to version 2 this                 feature used to be called Archived Names and permit just one alternative                 list of names; it now permits multiple lists and has a different                 interface.) </p>              <p>You can see and manage alternative naming schemes for taxa in                 the List of Taxa window. First, in the List of Taxa window choose<u>                 Columns&gt;Alternative Names</u>. A column will appear showing                 alternative names (if any). To create a list of alternative names,                 you can type the names directly in the Alternative Names column.                 Or, if you want to base the alternative names on existing names,                 you can touch on the column heading; a drop down menu will appear.                 Select Replace Alternatives by Taxon Names in order to put the                 current taxon names into the list of Alternatives.</p>              <p>Once you have a list of Alternative Names, you can save it as                 a stored alternative naming scheme by choosing Store Alternatives...                 from the column heading menu. Mesquite can store multiple alternative                 naming schemes in the file that you can later load, replace, or                 delete using items from the column heading drop down menu.</p>              <p>For instance, suppose you want to truncate taxon names for export,                 but you don't want to lose your original names. In the List of                 Taxa window, with Alternative Names showing, touch on the column                 heading and select Replace Alternatives by Taxon Names. Then,                 choose Store Alternatives... and enter the name &quot;Original                 Names&quot;. Now, you've successfully archived the original names.                 Truncate the taxon names (for instance using <u>List&gt;Taxon                 Names&gt;Truncate...</u>). Now, export the file as you wish. Once                 you're done, you might want to archive the truncated names also.                 From the column's menu, choose Trade Taxon Names with Alternatives                 to put the truncated names into the column, then choose Store                 Alternatives... to store the alternative naming scheme for the                 truncated names. The file should now have two stored naming schemes,                 the original and the truncated.</p>              <p>To set the current taxon names to be those in an archived alternative                 naming scheme, you must first load the alternative scheme into                 the Alternative Names column of the List of Taxa window, then                 select Trade Taxon Names with Alternatives or Replace Taxon Names                 by Alternatives in the column heading's menu.</p>              <h3><a name="groups"></a>Assigning group membership</h3>              <p>Taxa can be assigned to groups to form a partition of the taxa.                 Thus, taxa could be assigned to groups according to a traditional                 taxonomic scheme (some taxa in the group &quot;Vertebrates&quot;,                 others &quot;Invertebrates&quot;), or according to some quality                 such as distribution (&quot;Neotropical&quot;, &quot;Holarctic&quot;).                 The reason to assign taxa to groups is not to constrain trees                 or do formal analyses (these groups in most circumstances don't                 get involved in formal analyses) but rather for reasons of graphics                 and interface. Groups can be assigned colors, and thus taxa can                 be highlighed by their group's color wherever they appear (e.g.,                 in charts, in the Tree Window). (One analytical advantage is in                 multivariate analysis, where Canonical Variates uses the assigned                 groups as the prior grouping.)</p>              To assign taxa to groups, go to the List of Taxa window. Select               <font size="-1"> <u>Columns&gt;Group Membership (Taxa)</u></font>               to show the column indicating group membership. If you click on               the column heading &quot;Group&quot;, a menu will drop down with               menu items to manage group membership. You must first create groups               using New Group. For instance, you could create a group Neotropical               and another group Holarctic. Then, you can assign taxa to the group               using the Set Group submenu. You can also edit the color of the               group, and rename the group.               <h3> <a name="associatingTaxa"></a>Associating two taxa blocks</h3>              Associating the taxa in one block with taxa in another block is               useful in two contexts. First, you may want to indicate how genes               are assigned to species or parasites to hosts for studies of <a href="popGen/popGen.html#multiple">gene               tree/species tree or parasite tree/host tree relationships</a>.               Second, you may want to indicate equivalence of taxa in different               blocks, e.g., sequence matrices of different gene loci with slightly               different taxon names but pertaining to the same set of specimens               or species. This can be helpful for <a href="molecular/molecular.html#fusedMatrices">fused               export</a> into a single matrix.               <p> To set up an association between two taxa blocks, follow the                 instructions <a href="popGen/popGen.html#newassociation">here</a>.</p>              <!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>          </tr>        </table>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="100%">          <tr>             <td align="left" valign="top">               <hr>              <p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span class="smallplain"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org"><font size="2">Mesquite              Home Page</font></a><font size="2"> | <a href="manual.html">Mesquite              Manual</a></font></span></font></p>              <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span class="smallplain">Copyright                 &copy; 2002-2007 by <a href="http://salticidae.org/wpm/home.html">Wayne                 P.
