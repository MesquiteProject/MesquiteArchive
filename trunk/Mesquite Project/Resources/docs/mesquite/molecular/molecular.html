Cells                 can be colored according to the state at the site (<strong>Color                 Cells</strong> submenu, <strong>Character State</strong>) or according                 to a value like the GC bias (Color Cells submenu, <strong>Cell                 Value</strong>; can request this coloring to use a moving window).                 Examples of this are shown below. The Display submenu of the Matrix                 menu contains other options such as a <strong>Bird's eye view</strong>                 which makes the cells narrow to show more of the sequences.</p>              <p><strong>Copy Sequence</strong> (at bottom of Edit menu) copies                 the selected cells of the matrix into the computer's clipboard                 as a sequence. That is, whereas the standard Copy would place                 into the clipboard selected pieces of the matrix in tab-delimited                 text format (e.g., if the sequence AATCA is selected, &quot;A-tab-A-tab-T-tab-C-tab-A&quot;                 would be copied), this modified Copy Sequence command does not                 include tabs (thus, &quot;AATCA&quot; would be copied). This style                 of copying is useful when interacting with programs like <a href="http://www.genecodes.com">Sequencher                 (TM)</a>. For instance, if you want to find a piece of sequence                 in a matrix in Mesquite within a chromatogram viewer of Sequencher,                 do the following: select the sequence in Mesquite, choose Copy                 Sequence, then go to Sequencher, select Find Bases, and paste                 the sequence as the search string.</p>              <h3><a name="alignment"></a>Alignment</h3>              <p>The <protectedURL></protectedURL> <a href="%22../../../mesquite/align/aAlignIntro/index.html%22">Align</a></a>                 package contains utilities for sequence alignment. These include                 manual alignment tools (for shifting blocks of sequence, for example),                 and automated tools (e.g., sending a region of the matrix to ClustalW                 to align, or a pairwise alignment tool in the editor that will                 align one sequence to another). See the <protectedURL></protectedURL>                 <a href="%22../../../mesquite/align/aAlignIntro/index.html%22">Align</a>                 manual</a> for more details. </p>              <h3><a name="finding"></a>Finding Sequences</h3>              <p>You have several options to find sequences in a matrix. </p>              <p>First, you can use the Search Data <img src="../images/searchData.jpg" width="206" height="16">                 entry at the top of the Character Data Editor to enter a sequence                 and hit return. (If the entry indicates Search Features instead,                 touch on the brown &amp; or / until it shows a violet <img src="../images/searchDicon.jpg" width="12" height="14">                 and is labeled Search Data.) The results of the search will be                 displayed in the Search results window. </p>              <p>Second, pieces of sequences can be found using the Find Sequence                 and Find All Sequences submenus of the Edit menu. The current                 options are:</p>              <ul>                <li> <strong>Matching Sequence</strong>: This finds sequences                   matching a target sequence the user enters. The search allows                   a certain number of mismatches. Optionally, it can search for                   the reverse, complement and reverse complement of the target                   sequence. </li>                <li><font color="#000000"> <strong>Maintain Target Match</strong>:                   This highlights and maintains highlighted the first occurence                   of a given sequence in a given taxon. First, you are asked which                   taxon to search in. Then, it displays a panel like this:<br>                  <img src="../images/maintainTargetMatch.jpg" width="350" height="27"><br>                  underneath the matrix. The first button (red X) is to close                   the panel; the second pauses the search; the third allows you                   to select another taxon as your focus. If you type a sequence                   into the text area, the matching sequence (if any) will be highlighted                   in the matrix. Mesquite is constantly monitoring this text,                   and so you don't need to give any command to find again if you                   change the text. This is useful if working with a program like                   Sequencher. If you see a stretch of sequence while viewing chromatograms                   that you'd like to find in the matrix in Mesquite, type in the                   sequence into the text box and you will quickly be taken to                   it in the taxon.</font></li>                <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Maintain Clipboard Match</strong>:                   This is similar to Maintain Target Match, except that it obtains                   the search string not from the text area but from the clipboard.                   If the clipboard changes, the function will automatically find                   the sequence again in the matrix.

If both matrices belong to the                   same taxon block, then simply use the command to concatenate.                   On the other hand, if the matrices have overlapping but not                   identical taxon blocks, then you must bring both matrices along                   with their respective taxon blocks into memory. Let's assume                   you have two separate files, one for Gene 1 and one for Gene                   2. Copy the first file (so as to save an original copy of gene                   1 on its one), and give the copy a name like &quot;Fused.nex&quot;.                   Then, open it in Mesquite. Next, use Link File in the edit menu                   to read in the second file. Now, go to the Character Matrix                   Editor for the Gene 1 Matrix, and select Concatenate Matrices                   from the Utilities submenu. Later you can choose Close File                   from the File menu to close the linked file for gene 2, and                   save your fused file.</li>                <li><a name="fusedMatrices"></a><strong>Fused Matrix Export (NEXUS)</strong>:                   If the corresponding taxa have different names in the two matrices,                   then this is the easiest method to fuse, although it can also                   be useful when taxon names are the same. It is a special file                   exporter that can fuse matrices of different genes as it exports.                   It is available by choosing Export in the File menu. If you                   have a <strong>single taxa block</strong> with multiple matrices                   attached to it (e.g., one for each gene), then this exporter                   will write a single combined matrix with the sequences of different                   genes concatenated for each taxon. It will also write CHARPARTITION                   and CHARSETs to record which section of the fused matrix corresponds                   to which source matrix. It will also write a MrBayes block with                   that program's partitioning commands. If the different matrices                   are of mixed type (DNA, protein, non-molecular categorical)                   then you have a choice between reducing them to simple categorical                   data or maintaining a mixed matrix (suitable for MrBayes). Often                   however, you will have slightly different names for the sequences                   of different genes, and these may therefore exist in the file                   represented by <strong>different taxa blocks</strong>. For instance,                   you may have a taxa block with taxa &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;B1&quot;,                   and &quot;C1&quot; with corresponding matrix for COI sequences                   (gene 1) from species A, B and C, and another taxa block with                   taxa &quot;B2&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;, and &quot;D2&quot; for                   28S sequences (gene 2) from the same species. You want to fuse                   them as follows:<br>                  <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                    <tr>                       <td><div align="center"><img src="images/gene1beforeConcat2.jpg" width="72" height="58"></div></td>                      <td><div align="center"><img src="images/gene2beforeInclude.jpg" width="71" height="58"></div></td>                      <td><div align="center"><img src="images/becomesArrow.gif" width="44" height="14"></div></td>                      <td><div align="center"><img src="images/genesAfterConcat.jpg" width="102" height="77"></div></td>                    </tr>                  </table>                  The Fused Matrix exporter permits you to export these into a                   single matrix as long as you have indicated how the sequences                   correspond to one another. To do this, we suggest you create                   a new taxa block representing the species or specimens. In this                   example, create a taxa block &quot;Species&quot; with taxa A,                   B and C. This will be the &quot;master block of taxa&quot; that                   will organize the export. (Alternatively, you could choose one                   of the genes' taxa blocks as the master block.) <a href="../popGen/popGen.html#newassociation">Set                   up a Taxa Association</a> between the master block of taxa and                   each of the other blocks of taxa.

Set up the species-Gene 2 association                   similarly. The two taxa association will look like this in the                   List of Taxa window for the master taxa block:<br>                  <img src="images/assocBeforeFusedExport.gif" width="730" height="134">                   Then when you choose Fused Matrix Export, choose Species as                   your master taxa.

If a single master                   taxon has more than one corresponding taxa in one of the other                   matrices, the data are merged using the same rules as for <a href="../characters.html#mergetaxa">Merge                   Taxa</a>.</li>              </ul>              <h2><a name="managing"></a>Other Tools for Managing Molecular matrices</h2>              <p>Managing sequences in different matrices, especially if from                 different genes, can be difficult.
