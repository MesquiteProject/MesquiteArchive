This test was first described in Pagel                 (1994). Although this test has been available in Pagel&#8217;s                 own program Discrete, this module is not a simple translation                 of Discrete. In particular, although the module calculates the                 same likelihood value for a given combination of tree and character                 states, the maximum likelihood search and character simulation                 portions of the module utilize existing Mesquite code. The remainder                 of this documentation consists of an overview of the theory of                 the test, followed by detailed discussion of the methods used                 in the three phases of the test.</p>              <h4>Contents</h4>              <ul>                <li><a href="#theory">Theory</a></li>                <li><a href="#evaluator">The evaluator</a> </li>                <li><a href="#mle">The maximum likelihood estimation process</a></li>                <li><a href="#simulation">Estimating statistical significance</a></li>                <li><a href="#options">Options for Users</a></li>                <li><a href="#references">References</a></li>              </ul>              <h3><a name="theory" id="theory"></a>Theory</h3>              <p>Pagel (1994) describes a test of independent evolution of two                 binary characters. The test compares the ratio of likelihoods                 of two models: one model where the rates of change in each character                 are independent of the state of the other and a second model where                 rates of change depend on the state of the other character. The                 significance of the ratio is tested by comparison with simulated                 data, and Pagel warns against using a standard chi-square-based                 test in most cases. </p>              <p>The models are expressed as matrices of instantaneous transition                 rates, with each row and column specifying a pair of character                 states. The model of dependent change specifies 8 parameters and                 can be specified by the following matrix:</p>              <p><img src="images/p94Table1.jpg"></p>              <p>The zero values on the antidiagonal prevent simultaneous changes                 of both characters and the entries on the main diagonal normalize                 the matrix. </p>              <p> The model of independent change describes the case where the                 transition rates of each variable are independent of the state                 of the other. Pagel 1994 describes the independent model as a                 pair of 2x2 matrices, one for each variable. The forward (0-&gt;1)                 and backward (1-&gt;0) change rates of each variable are referred                 to as alpha and beta respectively. Another approach, taken in                 this module is to treat the independent case as a degenerate form                 of the dependent model. The model of independent change specifies                 4 parameters, which can be obtained from the dependent model by                 setting the pairs of parameters across the antidiagonal (q13 and                 q24, q12 and q34, q21 and q43, q31 and q42) equal.</p>              <p><img src="images/p94Table2.jpg" width="551" height="97"></p>              <p>Our treatment of the independent (four-parameter) model is different                 from Pagel's; we treat it as a version of the eight-parameter                 model constrained by setting four pairs of parameters equal (q13=q24,                 q12=q34, q21=q43, and q31=q42). Our four-parameter model specifies                 that the antidiagonal elements, indicating rates of simultaneous                 change, are also zero, in accord with the eight-parameter model                 used by us and Pagel. In contrast, Pagel (1994) treats his four-parameter                 model differently, as a combination of two separate asymmetric                 models, each represented by a 2x2 matrix. Thus, Pagel argues (p.                 41) that his four-parameter model is not a constrained version                 of the eight-parameter model. </p>              <p>We feel that our formulation of the four-parameter model is a                 valid alternative for three reasons. First, it uses the same assumption                 (zero rates of simultaneous change) as used in the eight-parameter                 model. Second, in our explorations it appeared to arrive at the                 same likelihoods as obtained by Pagel's two-asymmetric-model approach.                 We have tested the assumption of equivalence numerous times with                 both this module and Discrete. Even at high transition rates,                 we could find no differences between the two approaches that were                 not more appropriately explained as stochastic behavior in the                 likelihood searches of the respective programs. This stochastic                 behavior can be observed by simply re-running an analysis multiple                 times and looking at both the parameter estimates and (especially                 for the 8-parameter model) the likelihood values.&nbsp;</p>              <p>Third, setting the anti-diagonals to zero in the four parameter                 model appears justified on first principles. As Pagel points out                 (p. 40), setting simultaneous rates to zero does not preclude                 the possibility of both characters changing state over a longer                 period of time. However, because these are instantaneous rates,                 the diagonal indicates the rate of events where both characters                 change over the same infinitesimal time dt. No matter how large                 the rate of character change is, the amount of time spent in transitions                 is still zero, thus the chance of two independent characters changing                 at the same time is also zero.</p>              <p>To calculate the likelihood of a specific set of rates giving                 rise to the observed data at the tips of the particular tree,                 the rates must be converted to transition probabilities for each                 branch of the tree. Because the model is based on the assumption                 of a Markov process, the transition probabilities for a particular                 branch are dependent only on the rate matrix and the length of                 the branch. The conversion entails calculating exp(lA) where A                 is the rate matrix and l is the branch length.</p>              <p>The calculation itself starts from the tips of the tree and works                 down each branch toward the root. At each branch the calculated                 likelihoods at the upper end are (effectively) multiplied by a                 transpose of the transition matrix to obtain the set of likelihoods                 at the lower end. The likelihoods at the tips are just the observed                 data.</p>              <p>There are several possible ways to combine likelihood calculations                 at the root. Currently the module simply adds the likelihoods                 for each of the four possible root states to get the overall likelihood                 for the model. Other combination options, including weighting                 root states empirically from their frequencies at the tips or                 by specifying an explicit prior distribution may be made available                 in future releases.</p>              <h3><a name="evaluator" id="evaluator"></a>The Evaluator</h3>              <p>The evaluator calculates the likelihood of a specific set of                 rates giving rise to the observed data at the tips of the particular                 tree. This release uses two methods to calculate the exponentation                 of the rate matrix. The first method, which is faster, uses spectral                 decomposition (e.g., eigenvalues and eigenvectors). However, this                 method does not work correctly when the matrix has complex eigenvalues.                 In this case, or any other where the spectral decomposition method                 produces a transition probability matrix with negative entries,                 the evaluator redoes the calculation using a method first described                 by Putzer (1966). This method is slower, but appears to handle                 matrices with complex eigenvalues correctly.               <p>The current release does not allow the user to directly specify                 a set of parameter values and get a likelihood value. This facility                 may be added to future releases.               <p>               <h3> <a name="mle" id="mle"></a>The Maximum likelihood estimation                 process</h3>              <p>To estimate maximum likelihood values for the model parameters,                 the Pagel94 module requires an optimizer that works with multiple                 variables and does not require derivatives of the function being                 optimized. To do this, the module calls on the widely used Brent(1973)                 multivariate optimizer. This optimizer has the important property                 of not requiring derivatives of the function being maximized.                 To improve the chances of finding a global minimum, the module                 adds two methods to the optimization process. First the tree is                 scaled to a height of one, which reduces the changes of overflow.                 Second the module chooses the best result from multiple optimizer                 runs starting from different points. For optimizing the independent                 (four parameter) model, the module runs the optimizer from three                 start points (10, 10, 10, 10), (0.01, 10, 0.01, 10), and (10,                 0.01, 10, 0.01).               <p>Because dependent (eight parameter) models generally have more                 rugged likelihood surfaces, we found that additional searching                 sometimes produced substantially better answers. One example of                 this is the great ape data set discussed in Pagel94 and (in expanded                 form) in the Discrete manual. To choose multiple starting points,                 the model starts by estimating parameters for two six-parameter                 models, one where the rates of the first variable is dependent                 on the second but rates of the second are independent of the first                 (four rates for the first variable + two rates for the second),                 and the other with the dependencies reversed. Each six parameter                 model is optimized starting from the (saved) optimum of the four                 parameter model, with the additional parameters started from initial                 values that correspond to the four parameter model. <a name="multiplestartpoints"></a>The                 search for the eight- parameter model uses <strong>multiple start                 points</strong> derived from the six-parameter model results.                 The first two searches start from the values from each of the                 six-parameter models. Additional searches, controlled by the Likelihood                 iterations command, start from randomized linear combinations                 of the values from the six-parameter models. Specifically, the                 first four parameters for the eight-parameter search start from                 points on the line lying between the corresponding parameters                 for the six-parameter models. Because the random element is Gaussian                 distributed, the actual start point may lay outside the portion                 bracketed by the two values. The remaining four values are set                 from a corresponding parameter drawn from one of the six-parameter                 models with Gaussian noise added.               <p>Note that the value of additional iteration depends both on the                 particular tree and data and on the goal of the analysis. If finding                 the best values for the parameters is important, more iteration                 will do a more through search of parameter space. If the goal                 is simply to perform a test of independence, less iteration and                 more simulation is appropriate.               <p>Because Discrete uses a different optimizer than this module,                 the likelihoods and parameters found will not be identical in                 many cases. For most applications the differences will not be                 important. In other cases, the additional search this module provides                 should provide more optimal results.               <h3><a name="simulation" id="simulation"></a>Estimating Statistical                 Significance</h3>              <font face="Trebuchet MS">               <p>Pagel (1994) strongly recommends testing the observed likelihood                 ratios by running Monte Carlo tests using simulated data. Specifically,                 for the test of correlated evolution described by Pagel (1994),                 the four-parameter model is not exactly a special case of the                 eight-parameter model because dual transitions in the rate matrix                 (the antidiagonal elements) have been set to zero. Therefore,                 Pagel (1994) does not consider a likelihood ratio test based on                 a chi-square distribution with four degrees of freedom to be appropriate.                 Although a chi-square test might be better justified in Mesquite's                 implementation because we use a different four parameter model,                 it is unclear how well the chi-square will approximate the correct                 distribution at our sample sizes. Thus, we recommend a simulation                 as does Pagel.               <p>As discussed above, for estimating statistical significance,                 it is better to trade off optimizer iterations for simulation                 sets. Note that if the optimizer appears to hang (e.g., neither                 progress indicator appears to be updating), it is possible to                 abort the simulation. In this case, the module will calculate                 Monte Carlo statistics based on however many simulations it did                 complete, which might usable in some cases. We recommand for published                 results that significance be estimated using 1000 or more simulation                 replicates.               <p> </font>               <h3> <a name="options" id="options"></a>Options for Users</h3>              <p>There are three options for users to choose. When first requested,                 a dialog box will ask the user for these; once the analysis has                 been done, the options can be changed via the Pagel94 menu.               <ul>                <li><strong>Extra iterations</strong>: as noted <a href="#multiplestartpoints">above</a>,                   the estimation of likelihood of the 8 parameter model can be                   requested to use multiple start points.
