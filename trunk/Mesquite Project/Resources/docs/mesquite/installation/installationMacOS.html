This starts the most current version of Java on your     computer. The other versions (1.3, 1.4, 1.5) start specific versions. If there     appear to be graphical bugs/glitches, these other versions might work slightly     better for you, depending on exactly which versions of OS X and Java you have     installed. We recommend the most current versions of OS X and Java.</ol>		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>		<p>Requirements: OS X 10.4 or higher recommended; 10.1 with java update 1 has   some especially frustrating bugs; Mesquite is more or less unusable with OS   X 10.0. </p><p>NOTE: If you have a <b>previous version</b> of Mesquite installed in your system,   we advise that you delete it before installing the new version.
