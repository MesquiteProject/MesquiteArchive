This will create a   folder approximately as follows:</p>		<p><img src="images/installMac.gif"></p>		<p>To start Mesquite, you can double click either the icon &quot;Mesquite OS 9&quot;, or double click a data file in &quot;example files&quot;.</p>		<p>NOTE: If you have a <b>previous version</b> of Mesquite installed in your system, we advise that you delete it before running the new version.</p>		<h3>For Mac OS X</h3>		<p>Requirements: OS X 10.3 or 10.2 recommended; 10.1 with java update 1 has some   especially frustrating bugs; Mesquite is more or less unusable with OS X 10.0.   Mesquite can be run in one of two ways on OS X. If you use the application &quot;Mesquite   OS X&quot;, Mesquite will run under java 1.3.1 if available. This is the best-tested   style. Alternatively, if you have Java 1.4.2 Update 2 and you use the application   &quot;Mesquite OSX (Java 1.4)&quot;, Mesquite will run under java 1.4.2. This   appears to be less stable than 1.3.1. Do not attempt to use &quot;Mesquite OSX   (Java 1.4)&quot; if you have a version of Java 1.4 prior to 1.4.2 Update 2.   (The problems with early versions of Java 1.4 appear to be restricted to Mac   OS X.)</p><p>Instructions: If you download the dmg file above, double click on the file to mount the disk image.  Drag the contained &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot; to your hard drive to install.  Otherwise, download and unstuff the .sit file above. Both methods will create a folder &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot;   whose contents will be approximately as follows:</p><p><img src="images/installMacOSX.gif" width="490" height="377"></p><p>To start Mesquite, you can double click either the icon &quot;Mesquite OSX&quot;,   or double click a data file in &quot;examples&quot;.</p><p>NOTE: If you have a <b>previous version</b> of Mesquite installed in your  system,  we advise that you delete it before running the new version. </p>		<p>More details of issues of using Mesquite under Mac OS X are described in the   <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">Support</a>   page.</p>		<p>		<hr>Copyright &copy; 2002-2005 W. &amp; D.
