You will see a Mesquite_Folder. Drag this Mesquite_Folder     to your hard drive (e.g., your Applications folder). Its contents should look     like this:     <p><img src="images/osXinstall.jpg" width="757" height="456"></p>  <li>Double click one of the Mesquite icons to start Mesquite. We suggest you     try first Mesquite OSX. This starts the most current version of Java on your     computer. The other versions start Java 1.4 or allocate more memory. You might     want to try these if you are having problems with the normal version. We recommend     the most current versions of OS X and Java.   <li>You will also notice the file &quot;Run_Mesquite_OSX.command&quot;. This     contains the command needed to start Mesquite as if from the command line.     You can edit this command (using a text editor) to fine-tune the amount of     memory allocated to Mesquite, and perhaps to modify startup conditions.   <li>To change the <strong>memory allocation</strong> of the &quot;Mesquite OSX     (hi-mem)&quot; control-click (right click) on the application, and from the     drop down menu choose Show Package Contents. Inside, go to Contents/info.plist.     Open this file with a text editor, and in the line &quot; &lt;string&gt;-Xmx512m     -Djava.library.path=lib&lt;/string&gt;&quot; change the number 512 either     higher or lower (do not introduce spaces!). </ol>		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>		<p>Requirements: OS X 10.4 or higher recommended; Java 1.4 or later. </p><p>NOTE: If you have a <b>previous version</b> of Mesquite installed in your system,   we advise that you delete it before installing the new version.
