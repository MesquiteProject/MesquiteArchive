First, however, you may want to take from Mesquite_Folder/mesquite   any third party packages (e.g., PDAP, TreeSetViz) before deleting the directory.</p><p>In order to run Mesquite, you must have Java 1.4 or newer installed on your   computer. We recommend you install the latest version of Java before installing   Mesquite (<a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>). <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">Java   Standard Edition 5.0</a> is suitable (JRE 5.0).</p>		<p>Instructions:</p><ol>  <li>Download the <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstaller.exe">Mesquite     Installer</a>. There is also a special installer for a high-memory version     of Mesquite <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstallerHiMem.exe">here</a>.     You might want to use the high memory version if you are using many trees,     large trees, or large matrices.</li>  <li>Run the installer. It runs as a wizard. Once it is done, you should see     a Mesquite folder something like this:<br>    <br>    <img  src="images/installWin3.gif" width="879" height="385"><br>  </li>  <li>The file &quot;Mesquite&quot; with the icon is the Mesquite executable.     Double click this to start Mesquite.</li>  <li>You will notice a file called &quot;Run_Mesquite_Windows.bat&quot; in the     Mesquite_Folder. This is a batch file that contains the command line instruction     to start Mesquite. If you double click this file, Mesquite will start. We     include this file because you can modify the command line to change how Mesquite     runs when you double click the batch file. In particular, you can change the     number &quot;400&quot;, the memory allocation, to higher numbers if you need     more memory (don't introduce spaces!).</li></ol><p>More details of issues of using Mesquite under Windows are described in the   <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">Support</a>   page.</p>		<p>		<hr>Copyright 2002-2007 W. &amp; D.
