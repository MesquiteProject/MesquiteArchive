(It is best to get Sun's Java VM; Mesquite does   not run on some third-party virtual machines.) See notes on the <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">support</a>   page, especially regarding issues with window and dialog size and placement.</p>		        <p>Instructions:</p><p>Download and decompress this file:</p>		<ul>			  <li type="disc"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/mesquite.tgz">.tgz     file</a> </ul>		<p> It will create a directory called &quot;Mesquite_Folder&quot; in which all   the relevant files reside. The main class file is mesquite.Mesquite. To start   Mesquite you can use jre or java. For instance you could use:</p>		<pre>     java -cp /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>		<p>where /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder could be replaced by whatever is the		  path to the Mesquite_Folder. On some systems the java virtual machine		  is started by &quot;jre&quot; instead		  of &quot;java&quot;, and thus the command would be:</p>		<pre>     jre -cp /home/myuser/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>		<p>Depending on your configuration, you may need to give the explicit path		  to the java virtual machine, as in:</p>		<pre>/usr/java/jre1.4.2/bin/java -cp /usr/local/Mesquite_Folder mesquite.Mesquite</pre>		<p>If you've changed the name of Mesquite_Folder to, for instance, &quot;Mesquite1&quot;, you may need to use a command like:</p>		<pre>/usr/java/jre1.4.2/bin/java -cp /usr/local/Mesquite1 mesquite.Mesquite</pre>        <p></p>        <p>To make it easier to start up		    Mesquite each time, you may want to make a shell script containing		    the appropriate command.</p>		<p>Once Mesquite has finished		  loading, go to the File menu to	    open a file.</p>		<p>If the current user directory is not the Mesquite_Folder, and Mesquite has   not been run before, Mesquite may ask you to find the file &quot;manual.html&quot;   which resides in the <b>Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/</b> directory. This will   help Mesquite find and remember where its files are.</p>		<h3>Window Managers</h3>		<p>Mesquite attempts to place windows in particular places on the screen for ease of use, using standard Java calls. Some window managers override this, resulting in haphazard placement of windows. You may need to change your window manager if this sort of thing is happening.</p>		<p>More details of issues of using Mesquite under Linux/UNIX are described in   the <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">Support</a>   page. <hr>Copyright 2002-2006 W. &amp; D.
