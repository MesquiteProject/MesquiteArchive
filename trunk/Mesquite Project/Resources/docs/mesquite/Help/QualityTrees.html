			<h2>Publication Quality Trees</h2>
			<p>Mesquite is not designed for rigorous tree-estimation procedures, such a Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, or 
			Bayesian tree estimation.  However, trees generated from programs such as PAUP, PHYLIP, and MrBayes can be read into 
			and manipulated in Mesquite.  This guide will help you perform these manipulations to create a tree usable for 
			scientific publication.  Users should begin by familiarizing themselves with the <a href="../managingFiles.html"
			title="Managing Files in Mesquite">Mesquite file structure</a>.</p>
			<h4><strong>Step 1: Get a tree</strong></h4>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Within Mesquite</strong> &#8212; Mesquite can provide trees from simulations, some basic tree 
				searches, or default trees.  If you do not have trees from other sources, you can open a tree window from
				the Taxa&amp;Trees menu by selecting <u><font size="-1">New Tree Window</font></u>.  If you have multiple
				taxa blocks in the file, you will be prompted to choose among the blocks included in the file.  You will
				then be asked to choose a tree source.  There are at least 13 different sources for trees, but we will 
				only deal with the first two here.  &quot;Stored Trees&quot; refers to trees that are stored in the 
				Mesquite file.  If you haven't stored any trees in the file yet, this option won't be available.  Selecting
				&quot;Default Trees&quot; will open a Tree Window corresponding to a Tree Block with three trees: a 
				fully resolved symmetrical tree (Default symmetrical), a completely unresolved tree (Default bush) and 
				a ladderized tree (Default ladder) (the names of trees are shown in the panel beneath the the tree).  
				You may manupilate any one of these trees, but be sure to store a copy of the tree in the 
				Mesquite file (<u><font size="-1">Tree &gt; Store Copy of Tree As...</font></u>), or it will be lost.</li>
				<li><strong>Other sources</strong> &#8212; When importing trees from other files, be sure that the taxon 
				names from the tree file match the taxon names in the Mesquite File. Although importated trees may contain 
				fewer taxa than are in the Taxa Block, they cannot contain taxa that are <i>not</i> included in the 
				Mesquite file.  If the trees you wish to import contain taxa that are not represented in the Taxa Block 
				you should either (1) add those taxa to the correspondidng taxa block in Mesquite (<u><font size="-1">
				List &gt; Add Taxa...</font></u> from Taxa Window) or (2) delete 
				those taxa from the tree file before importing them into Mesquite.  We recommend the former (adding 
				Taxa to file), in 
				order to reduce the probabilty of inadvertantly altering tree structure.
				<br>
				Importing trees from files can be 
				done through <u><font size="-1">Taxa &amp;Trees &gt; Import File with Trees...</font></u> menu option.  To 
				include the trees in the Mesquite file, select &quot;Include Contents...&quot;.  Alternatively, you may 
				open a Tree Window corresponding to trees from external sources from <u><font size="-1">Taxa&amp;Trees &gt; New 
				Tree Window</font></u> by selecting &quot;Use Trees from Separate File&quot; as the source of trees for the 
				new Tree Window.  
				<br>
				<b>Note:</b> if you are importing trees from PAUP, and would like to retain
				the branch lengths, you must be sure  to save the branch lengths
				from within	PAUP. From the command line in PAUP, use the <font face="Courier 
				New, Courier, monospace"><b>brlens = yes</b></font> option in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>
				savetrees</b></font> command.  If you are using PAUP with menus, you can
				save the branch lengths when saving 	the tree (<font face="System"><b>Trees &gt; Save
				Trees to File...</b></font>) 
				by clicking on the <font face="System">Options...</font> tab and checking
				the box <font face="System">Include 
				branch lengths</font>. If you want Mesquite to display bootstrap values generated
				by PAUP, then in the <b> savetrees</b> command use <b>savebootp = brlens</b> option;
				in the version of PAUP with menus, use the  Options... tab and
				ask	to save bootstrap proportions as branch lengths.</li>
				</ul>

			<h4><strong>Step 2: Choose Tree Form</strong></h4>
			Some examples of Tree Forms:
			<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
				<tr>
                  <td align="center"> <div align="center"><img src="images/diagonalTree.gif" width="144" height="170"></div></td>
                  <td align="center"> <div align="center"><img src="images/squareTree.gif" width="144" height="170"></div></td>
                  <td align="center"> <div align="center"><img src="images/curvogramTree.gif" width="144" height="170"></div></td>
                  <td align="center"> <div align="center"><img src="images/ballsNSticksTree.gif" width="144" height="170"></div></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
                  <td align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Diagonal</font></td>
                  <td align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Square</font></td>
                  <td align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Curvogram</font></td>
                  <td align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Balls N Sticks</font></td>
				</tr>
 			</table>
			
			<p>Most trees are published as &quot;Square Trees&quot;, which you can select from the Drawing menu in the Tree 
			Window.  There are a variety of other formats available, which we encourage you to explore, but some of the 
			following instructions will only apply to square trees (this is noted where it applies).</p> 
			
			<h4><strong>Step 3: Branch Lengths</strong></h4> 
			<p>To show branch lengths of a tree, select <u><font size="-1">Drawing &gt; Branches Proportional to 
			Lengths</font></u>.  The branches will now reflect lengths, and a scale is shown.  You can toggle the scale 
			off/on from the Drawing menu (<u><font size="-1">Drawing &gt; Show Scale</font></u>).  Note: if the branch
			lengths for a tree are unassigned, and Branches Proportional to Lengths is selected, the tree will be drawn 
			with arbitrary branch lengths (usually so that each branch has a length of 1.0) and the scale shown.  If 
			you don't know if the tree has branch lengths assigned, see the instructions for viewing the tree in 
			<a href="QualityTrees.html#newick" title="Newick format of branch lengths">newick</a> format, below.  
			Alternatively, you can check branch lengths by using the &quot;Adjust Branch Length&quot; tool 
			(<img src="../images/treeTools/adjustBranchLength.gif" width="26" height="26">); if a branch does not have a 
			branch length assigned, the box that opens when you use the Adjust Branch Length tool will show a &quot;?&quot;.</p>
			
			<h4>Step 4: Branch Colors</h4>
			<p>There are two approaches to coloring branches, the first colors all branches of the tree, and the second applies 
			different colors to different branches (there is a third means of coloring branches, according to Character 
			Reconstructions, but for this step, we only discuss the first two).  To color all the branches of a tree, select 
			<u><font size ="-1">Drawing &gt; Branch Color</font></u> and choose from the list of available colors.</p> 
			<p>To color individual branches, you can use the Branch Coloring tool (<img src="../images/color.gif" width="16" 
			height="16">) from the Tree Window tool palette on the	left-hand side of the Tree Window.  This tool can be used to 
			add colors for cosmetic effect to a tree (these colors play no role in analyses, and are not dictated by character 
			states per se.  See &quot;Character Reconstructions&quot; under step 6 below for branch coloring that based on 
			character reconstructions).  To set the color, right/control-click on the Branch Coloring tool icon, select Branch 
			Paint Color, and choose from the list of available colors.  Clicking on a branch with this tool will color that 
			branch, control-clicking on a branch will color that branch, and all the descendant branches.</p>
			<p>You can remove colors from branches by right/control-clicking on the Branch Coloring tool icon, and selecting 
			Remove Color.  The Remove Color tool works the same way as the branch coloring tool on single branches (click) and 
			entire clades (control-click).  You can also remove all colors from a tree by selecting Remove All Color from the 
			Branch Coloring Tool icon options. It is important to note that colors added with the Branch Coloring tool will always
			be on top - any color changes applied from the <u><font size="-1">Drawing &gt; Branch Colors</font></u> will not be 
			visible on branches that have been colored using the Branch Coloring tool.</p> 
			
			<h4><strong><a name="taxonNameColors">Step 5: Taxon Name Colors</a></strong></h4>
			<p>To color taxon names, you can partition the taxa into groups (groups are not the same as 
			<a href="../popGen/popGen.html#establishing" title "establishing associations">associations</a>.  
			To set a group, first go to the Taxa window for the Taxon block that contains 
			the Taxon names you'd like to color (this will be the taxon block that corresponds to the tree window you are 
			looking at). There should be a &quot;Group&quot; column on the list.  If not, you can show the column by 
			selecting <u><font size="-1">Columns &gt; Group Membership (taxa)</font></u>.  First, select all the taxa 
			in your first group.  Using the small black triangle at the top of the column, select <u><font size="-1">New 
			group...</font></u> (clicking once on the black triangle will bring up the Group menu).  In the New Taxon 
			Group dialog, type a name for this Group, and select a color.  From the Group menu (accessible from the top 
			of the Group column), you can create additional new Groups, edit current Groups, and set Group membership.  
			For the latter, select the taxa you wish to place in the group, and select <u><font size="-1">Set Group 
			&gt;</font></u> from the Group menu (the list of groups is shown).  Each taxon can only be assigned to a 
			single Group.  The taxon names in the Tree Window should be the same color as assigned to the Group.  If 
			they are not, you can color them so by selecting, in the Tree Window, <u><font size = "-1">Drawing &gt; 
			Names &gt; Color by Taxon Group</font></u>.  Alternatively, you can color the background of the taxon text 
			by taxon group by selecting <u><font size = "-1">Drawing &gt; Names &gt; Background Color by 
			Taxon Group</font></u>.  Of course, you'll likely want to turn off Color by Taxon Group, or the names 
			will be the same color as the background, and thus won't be visible! Because taxa can only be assigned 
			membership to one Group, if you would like to draw more than one tree, which differ only in Taxon Name 
			coloration (topology and branch lengths being the same), it would be easiest to draw the tree first with 
			one set of Group memberships, then save the file under a different name, and in the new file, change the 
			Group memberships.  This will make it easier to assign different Group memberships without overwriting 
			other desired memberships.</p> 
			
			<h4><strong>Step 6: Extras</strong></h4>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Support Values as Branch Labels</strong> - If you would like to
			  add support values to your tree, there are different ways to do
			  so, depending on how you initially got the trees. Some programs
			  save values as
			  branch labels, then this section applies (if they program saves
			  values as branch lengths, then see the next section). Bayesian
			  trees from MrBayes usually contain the posterior probabilities,
			  so they should be visible when you load the trees into Mesquite.
			  If they are not, and the posterior probabilities are in the tree
			  in Newick format, you can turn them on by
			  
			selecting <u><font size="-1">Drawing &gt; Names &gt; Show Branch Names</font></u>.
			If you're not sure if  the support values are in the Newick format
			tree, click	on the &quot;Text&quot; tab in the Tree Window.  
			You will see the line &quot;Tree Description&quot;, which shows the tree in
			Newick format. If the support  values are present, they will be evident
			as	a string of characters immediately following the right parenthesis
				of a clade. 
			<br>  
			<a name="newick">For example</a>, this tree, 
			
			<center><img src="images/abcTree.GIF" width="265" height="164"></center>
			<br>
			in newick format, lacking branch lengths, would be:<br>
			<br>
			<center>((A, B)100, C)75 </center>
			<br>
			The same tree, if it had branch lengths of 10 and 5 for clades AB and ABC respectively: <br>
			<br>
			<center>((A, B)100:10, C)75:5 </center>
			<br>
			If the tree does not show support values, you will need to enter them using the Node Namer tool 
			(<img src="images/nodeNamer.gif" width="16" height="16">). The default position for support values is on the 
			node of the tree; however, published phylogenetic trees usually have support values centered on the branches.  
			If you are using a Square Tree, you can center the support values on a branch by selecting <u><font size="-1">
			Drawing &gt; Names &gt; Center Branch Names</font></u> (note: this option is currently only available for 
			Square Trees).  If the support values overlap (this will be an inevitability as the number of taxa &amp; 
			support values increases), you will need to save the tree in pdf format (step 7 below) and use a graphics 
			editing program (Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.) to correct the overlap.<br>
			<br>
			If the branch labels are not in the format you would like (for example,
			they are shown as decimal values from 0.0 to 1.0, but you want them
			to be percentages from 0 to 100), then you should convert them to
			branch lengths first, which would then give Mesquite the option to
			change how the numbers are displayed. To convert them to branch lengths,
			choose <u>Tree &gt; Alter/Transform Branch Lengths &gt;</u>,
			and in the dialog box that appears choose Assign Branch Lengths from
			Node Names. 	You can then show the
			values using the information provided in the next section.<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><strong>Support Values as Branch Lengths</strong> - If support values
			  are saved as branch lengths (for example,  if you used the <b>savebootp
			  = brlens</b> option in the <b> savetrees</b> command to save the tree resulting
			  from a bootstrap analysis in PAUP), then you can see the values
			  on that tree in the tree window by choosing <u>Drawing &gt; Branch Length
			  Labels &gt; Show Labels.</u> The <u>Branch Length Labels</u> submenu allows
			  you to adjust how the values are displayed, including the number
			  of decimal places (for standard
			  bootstrap values, you might wish to change this value to zero),
			  whether or not the terminal branches have values displayed, and
			  the color of the label. If the values are shown from 0.0 to 1.0, but you
			  wish to change them so that they show percentages, you can
			  multiply all values by 100 using  <u>Tree &gt; Alter/Transform
			  Branch Lengths &gt; Scale All Branch Lengths...</u>.<br>
            </li>
			<li><strong>Character Reconstructions</strong> - You can trace character reconstructions on trees by 
			selecting <u><font size="-1">Analysis &gt; Trace Character History</font></u>.  Most likely, you will be 
			tracing Stored Characters.  Note that tracing a character history will &quot;fill&quot; the branches with 
			a particular color, so that any colors added using the Branch Coloring tool or the Branch Color menu item 
			in the Drawing menu will only outline the branch.  <a href="../CharacterEvolution/AncestralStates.html"

			<h4><strong>Step 7: Exporting the Tree</strong></h4>
			<p>When you're satisfied with the tree in the Tree Window, select <u><font size="-1">File &gt; Save Tree as 
			PDF...</font></u> (you can add the extension &quot;.pdf&quot; when you save the tree.  Mesquite will not 
			do this automatically, but applications capable of reading pdf files will still be able to open it without 
			the extension).</p>
