This makes it easier to annotate                   without having to manipulate two windows. This panel can be                   requested by the <strong>Show Annotations Panel</strong> item                   in the Matrix menu, or by touching on the small button (<img src="images/annot.gif" width="16" height="12">)                   near the lower left of the Matrix Editor (beneath the taxon                   names). The pencil tool (<img src="images/notesTool.gif" width="16" height="16">)                   has disappeared. Another change is that images in annotations                   can now be remote (i.e. URL's). Also, the annotations panel                   is also available in the List of Taxa window (for annotating                   taxa) and the List of Characters window (for annotating characters).                   In the list windows, the panel can be requested by touching                   on the small button (<img src="images/annot.gif" width="16" height="12">)                   at lower left of the table.</li>                <li>Annotations can now be attached to the states of a categorical                   character, within the State Names Editor (available from the                   Matrix menu of the Character Matrix Editor). The annotations                   can be viewed by choosing <strong>Show State Annotations</strong>                   in the State_Names menu or by touching on the small button at                   lower left of the table (<img src="images/annot.gif" width="16" height="12">).</li>                <li>A legend is now available for the colors in a Character Matrix                   Editor. The legend can be shown by selecting <strong>Show Color                   Legend</strong> in the Matrix menu, or by touching the small                   button(<img src="images/colorLegend.gif" width="16" height="12">)                   at lower left of the Matrix Editor (beneath the taxon names).                   If you double click on a color in the matrix, the editor will                   move to a cell with that color.</li>                <li>There are buttons at the lower left of the Character Matrix                   Editor to open the List of Characters window (<img src="images/listC.gif" width="16" height="12">)                   and the List of Taxa window (<img src="images/listT.gif" width="16" height="12">).                   Reciprocally, the List of Characters window has a button (<img src="images/matrix.gif" width="16" height="12">)                   to show the Character Matrix Editor.</li>                <li>Character matrices can now be viewed in a &quot;<strong>Birds-eye                   view</strong>&quot; with very narrow columns.</li>                <li>There is a <strong>State Names Strip</strong> available for                   categorical matrices under the Matrix menu. This shows a strip                   along the bottom of the matrix in which the names of characters                   and states are shown. Similarly when Bird's Eye View is used                   for a matrix, a <strong>Bird's Eye Closeup Strip</strong> appears                   below the matrix so that you can more clearly see the states                   of the characters of focus. Both of these strips can be made                   higher by going to their upper edges, clicking and dragging                   upward.</li>                <li>You can now view a character matrix in more than one window,                   by requesting an <strong>Extra Matrix Editor</strong> from the                   Characters menu. This is useful, for instance, if you want to                   have the cells of the two matrices colored differently.</li>                <li>The order of characters can now be managed through stored                   character orders. A <strong>Default Order</strong> of characters                   is automatically stored as characters are created. This default                   order is visible in the List of Characters window as the first                   column. If the order of characters is accidentally or intentionally                   changed (for instance using the <strong>Sort Tool</strong>)                   then the default order can be recovered easily by applying the                   Sort Tool to the Default Order column of the List of Characters                   window. In addition, you can store and reload other character                   orderings by showing the <strong>Stored Character Order</strong>                   in the List of Characters window (List menu, Show Column submenu).                   You can store the current ordering and recover previously stored                   orderings using the drop down menu from the Stored Order column                   heading. When you do this, you will see the numbers in the column                   change, but the characters will not immediately be reordered.                   The reason for this is that what is stored and displayed is                   simply a number for each character marking its position. It                   is up to you to use that ordering to resort the characters.                   Thus, to recover a former sequence of characters, load the stored                   ordering, then touch on its column with the sort tool. </li>                <li><font color="#000000">There are new facilities for <strong>searching                   for sequences</strong> in molecular data files. Thes are found                   in the Edit menu for editor windows of molecular sequence data.                   These are: </font>                   <ul>                    <li> <font color="#000000"><strong>Copy Sequence</strong>                       (at bottom of Edit menu): This copies the selected cells                       of the matrix into the computer's clipboard as a sequence.                       That is, whereas the standard Copy would place into the                       clipboard selected pieces of the matrix in tab-delimited                       text format (e.g., if the sequence AATCA is selected, &quot;A-tab-A-tab-T-tab-C-tab-A&quot;                       would be copied), this modified Copy Sequence command does                       not include tabs (thus, &quot;AATCA&quot; would be copied).                       This style of copying is useful when interacting with programs                       like <a href="http://www.genecodes.com">Sequencher (TM)</a>.                       For instance, if you want to find a piece of sequence in                       a matrix in Mesquite within a chromatogram viewer of Sequencher,                       do the following: select the sequence in Mesquite, choose                       Copy Sequence, then go to Sequencher, select Find Bases,                       and paste the sequence as the search string.</font></li>                    <li><font color="#000000"> <strong>Maintain Target Match</strong>                       (in the Find Sequence submenu of the Edit menu): This highlights                       and maintains highlighted the first occurence of a given                       sequence in a given taxon. First, you are asked which taxon                       to search in. Then, it displays a panel like this:<br>                      <img src="images/maintainTargetMatch.jpg" width="350" height="27"><br>                      underneath the matrix. The first button (red X) is to close                       the panel; the second pauses the search; the third allows                       you to select another taxon as your focus. If you type a                       sequence into the text area, the matching sequence (if any)                       will be highlighted in the matrix. Mesquite is constantly                       monitoring this text, and so you don't need to give any                       command to find again if you change the text. This is useful                       if working with a program like Sequencher. If you see a                       stretch of sequence while viewing chromatograms that you'd                       like to find in the matrix in Mesquite, type in the sequence                       into the text box and you will quickly be taken to it in                       the taxon.</font></li>                    <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Maintain Clipboard Match</strong>                       (in the Find Sequence submenu of the Edit menu): This is                       similar to Maintain Target Match, except that it obtains                       the search string not from the text area but from the clipboard.                       If the clipboard changes, the function will automatically                       find the sequence again in the matrix. This is useful if                       working with a program like Sequencher. If you turn on Maintain                       Clipboard Match, then you can copy stretches of a sequence                       within Sequencher, and Mesquite will automatically highlight                       it, without your having to return to Mesquite or give any                       other command to it.

This can                   be turned on via the menu items <strong>Invent Unique IDs for                   New Taxa</strong> and <strong>Invent Unique IDs for New Characters</strong>                   in the Defaults menu of the Log window. When enabled, newly                   created characters and taxa are automatically assigned IDs which                   are maintained even if the taxa or characters are rearranged                   through reordering, additions or deletions. These unique IDs                   are little-used in Mesquite at present, but eventually will                   permit users to reassociate taxa and characters from different                   files even after names have been changed (for instance, to re-read                   a tree file saved with different taxon names). The IDs will                   also be used in database connectivity and collaborative features.                   To assign IDs to already-created taxa or characters, go to the                   List of Taxa or List of Characters windows and choose <strong>Unique                   IDs</strong> from the Show Column submenu of the List menu.                   IDs can be generated using the drop down menu from the column's                   header. The one disadvantage of assigning IDs is that the IDs                   are stored in the Taxa block and Characters block of the NEXUS                   file, which causes some programs to refuse to read the file. (PAUP* by default will refuse to read these files, but you                  can request that PAUP* ignore these extra commands by the command "set errorstop = no;"                  which is available in its Options Menu, Warnings and Errors.)</li>                <li>There has been a shift in NEXUS file format for <strong>annotations</strong>                   &#8212; the AN command is now used. This, unfortunately, produces                   files that are not readable by version 1.05. The reason for                   this change is to minimize text in the file when dealing with                   a large matrix with thousands of annotations.</li>                <li><strong>Pairwise comparisons</strong> were previously forced                   to find all possible pairs.

Thus, in previous                   versions the taxa were added one at a time to a tree growing                   through time. For example, if there are 6 taxa, then the divergence                   between the 6th taxon and its sister species was always the                   most recent divergence in the tree. While this would not affect                   questions about general tree symmetry (e.g. &quot;What is the                   distribution of tree asymmetries under uniform speciation?&quot;)                   or branch length distributions, it would affect questions about                   similarity between an observed tree and those expected under                   a null model of speciation.</li>                <li>fixed bug that caused a crash when characters were deleted                   from a matrix which had annotations, images or colors attached                   to the cells but which didn't have footnotes.</li>                <li>fixed a few minor bugs.</li>              </ul></p>              <h3>Version 1.03</h3>              <h4>New Features</h4>              <ul>                <li>added <strong>automatic file backup</strong>, which retains                   copies of previously saved versions of files.

This bug was generally innocent except if                   a linked file was subsequently unlinked from the main data file.                   This would leave the linked file with a relictual copy of the                   NOTES block. If the main data file was then edited (e.g., footnotes                   changed, characters deleted or moved), and then the secondary                   file was later linked again to the main data file, its relictual                   (and now out of date) NOTES block could override the current                   NOTES block in the main file. This could cause footnotes in                   the main data file to revert to former ones, or to be applied                   to inappropriate characters or taxa.

Prior to 1.02                   taxa and characters could be moved by clicking and dragging,                   but using this it was difficult to move them long distances                   through a matrix. <em>To use this</em>, select the taxa or characters                   to be moved in their respective List window, and select Move                   Selected from the List menu.</li>                <li>Taxon selecting in the tree window has been modified, with                   a new taxon select tool (<img src="images/selectTaxa.gif" width="16" height="16">).</li>                <li>Utilities to <strong>modify taxon names</strong> have been                   enhanced and added to the Character Matrix Editor in the Taxon                   Names submenu of the Matrix menu.</li>                <li>Added <strong>import/export of FASTA</strong> files</li>              </ul>              <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>              <ul>                <li>(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" width="14" height="14">)                   fixed calculation of Shared Partitions, which counted too many                   shared partitions between trees in some circumstances if the                   trees had different terminal taxa included</li>                <li>resolved conflict in interpetation of tree descriptions that                   would result in Mesquite's interpreting trees from MrBayes and                   other programs as having reticulations whenever labels for internal                   nodes were duplicated.
