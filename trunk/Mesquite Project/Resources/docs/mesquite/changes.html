The                   designed behavior is for the simulations to begin with a random                   number seed based on the current clock, and then from that calculate                   base seeds for each of the replicates using the procedure described                   below under version 1.1 bug fixes. Version 1.12 has been corrected                   to use this designed behavior. However, in 1.1 and 1.11 for                   several of the simulations the first replicate always used 1                   as its random number seed, although all subsequent replicates                   used the correct method as designed. This bug did not affect                   independence of replicates within a simulation of multiple replicates                   (except when multiple tree blocks were simulated using &quot;Simulated                   Tree Blocks&quot;), but it did affect independence among separate                   simulations/randomizations. Since the bug affected only the                   first replicate, it would not be expected to affect significance                   values unless very few replicates were used. The affected simulations/randomizations                   are: Simulated Trees (first tree used seed 1 always); Simulated                   Tree Blocks (first tree of each block used seed 1 always); Randomly                   Modify Trees (first tree used seed 1 always); Randomly Modify                   Matrices (first matrix used seed 1 always).</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" width="14" height="14">)                   When taxa are selected by the user and Rarefy Tree is used to                   generate trees with a requested number of taxa randomly deleted,                   taxa are chosen for deletion randomly only from among those                   currently selected. In previous versions of Mesquite this did                   not work correctly, in that frequently fewer than the requested                   number of taxa were deleted. This may have been evident to the                   user because the modified tree would have contained more taxa                   than expected. This bug is fixed in 1.12.</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" width="14" height="14">)                   The likelihood calculations for categorical characters were                   designed only for characters with a contiguous series of states                   starting at 0, and to prohibit other characters. That is, a                   character with states 0, 1, 2 would be permitted, but a character                   with states 1 and 2, or a character with states 0 and 2, would                   not be permitted. This requirement was mentioned in the manual,                   but the requirement was not enforced properly within the program,                   and thus Mesquite permitted the calculations with some such                   characters. The reconstructions are incorrect. In version 1.12                   the prohibition is correctly in place; Mesquite will refuse                   to calculate likelihoods with such characters.</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" width="14" height="14">)                   A single character matrix can be modified from various windows,                   such as the List of Characters window (e.g., by moving, deleting                   characters) and the Character Matrix Editor. When a character                   matrix editor is open and a cell is being edited, the editing                   field could sometimes be misapplied to the wrong character or                   taxon if elsewhere characters or taxa are deleted, added or                   changed in order. The effect of this is that the state of one                   character or taxon can get copied inadvertantly to another character                   or taxon.

(The correct                   state could always be seen, however, by holding the cursor over                   the branch.)

A <strong>Default                   Order</strong> of characters is automatically stored as characters                   are created. This default order is visible in the List of Characters                   window as the first column. If the order of characters is accidentally                   or intentionally changed (for instance using the <strong>Sort                   Tool</strong>) then the default order can be recovered easily                   by applying the Sort Tool to the Default Order column of the                   List of Characters window. In addition, you can store and reload                   other character orderings by showing the <strong>Stored Character                   Order</strong> in the List of Characters window (Columns menu).                   You can store the current ordering and recover previously stored                   orderings using the drop down menu from the Stored Order column                   heading. When you do this, you will see the numbers in the column                   change, but the characters will not immediately be reordered.                   The reason for this is that what is stored and displayed is                   simply a number for each character marking its position. It                   is up to you to use that ordering to resort the characters.                   Thus, to recover a former sequence of characters, load the stored                   ordering, then touch on its column with the sort tool. </font></li>                <li><font color="#000000" face="Trebuchet MS">There are new facilities                   for <strong>searching for sequences</strong> in molecular data                   files.

That is, whereas the standard Copy would                       place into the clipboard selected pieces of the matrix in                       tab-delimited text format (e.g., if the sequence AATCA is                       selected, &quot;A-tab-A-tab-T-tab-C-tab-A&quot; would be                       copied), this modified Copy Sequence command does not include                       tabs (thus, &quot;AATCA&quot; would be copied). This style                       of copying is useful when interacting with programs like                       <a href="http://www.genecodes.com">Sequencher (TM)</a>.                       For instance, if you want to find a piece of sequence in                       a matrix in Mesquite within a chromatogram viewer of Sequencher,                       do the following: select the sequence in Mesquite, choose                       Copy Sequence, then go to Sequencher, select Find Bases,                       and paste the sequence as the search string.</font></li>                    <li><font color="#000000" face="Trebuchet MS"> <strong>Maintain                       Target Match</strong> (in the Find Sequence submenu of the                       Edit menu): This highlights and maintains highlighted the                       first occurence of a given sequence in a given taxon. First,                       you are asked which taxon to search in.

The first button (red X) is to close                       the panel; the second pauses the search; the third allows                       you to select another taxon as your focus.

Mesquite is constantly                       monitoring this text, and so you don't need to give any                       command to find again if you change the text. This is useful                       if working with a program like Sequencher.

This can be turned on via the menu items <strong>Invent                   Unique IDs for New Taxa</strong> and <strong>Invent Unique IDs                   for New Characters</strong> in the Defaults menu of the Log                   window. When enabled, newly created characters and taxa are                   automatically assigned IDs which are maintained even if the                   taxa or characters are rearranged through reordering, additions                   or deletions. These unique IDs are little-used in Mesquite at                   present, but eventually will permit users to reassociate taxa                   and characters from different files even after names have been                   changed (for instance, to re-read a tree file saved with different                   taxon names). The IDs will also be used in database connectivity                   and collaborative features. To assign IDs to already-created                   taxa or characters, go to the List of Taxa or List of Characters                   windows and choose <strong>Unique IDs</strong> from the Columns                   menu. IDs can be generated using the drop down menu from the                   column's header. The one disadvantage of assigning IDs is that                   the IDs are stored in the Taxa block and Characters block of                   the NEXUS file, which causes some programs to refuse to read                   the file. (PAUP* by default will refuse to read these files,                   but you can request that PAUP* ignore these extra commands by                   the command "set errorstop = no;" which is available in its                   Options Menu, Warnings and Errors.)</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">There has been a shift in NEXUS                   file format for <strong>annotations</strong> &#8212; the AN                   command is now used.

If the main data file was                   then edited (e.g., footnotes changed, characters deleted or                   moved), and then the secondary file was later linked again to                   the main data file, its relictual (and now out of date) NOTES                   block could override the current NOTES block in the main file.                   This could cause footnotes in the main data file to revert to                   former ones, or to be applied to inappropriate characters or                   taxa. In addition to fixing this bug, we have added a warning                   that is given if Mesquite detects that a NOTES block is being                   overridden. If you suspect that your footnotes may have been                   corrupted by this bug, please contact us for assistance.</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">fixed a bug in Trees Directly from                   File that gave spurious warnings.</font></li>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">fixed various other small bugs</font></li>              </ul>              <hr>              <h3><font face="Trebuchet MS">Version 1.02</font></h3>              <h4><font face="Trebuchet MS">New Features</font></h4>              <ul>                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>multiple notes with images</strong>                   can now be associated with taxa, characters and cells of character                   matrices.

Now, multiple notes                   can be attached to each taxon, character, or cell of a matrix.                   Each note can have a comment, a reference, an image, and an                   author.
