                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">&quot;<strong>Phone home</strong>&quot; system. Mesquite now checks its website on startup to see if there are notices for users, for instance about updates or bugs. (This can be disabled in the Defaults submenu of the Edit menu.) Other packages can also be set to check their websites. This checking does not transmit data about you other that what your web browser does when you go to a website.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">The <strong>search</strong> facility to help you find features (&quot;Search Features&quot;, available in each window: <img src="images/searchFeaturesAND.jpg" width="225" height="16">) has been improved to include menu items and tools in open windows.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">To help minimize user confusion, there are new options in  how Mesquite by default presents choices of modules to the user. First, dialog boxes that offer a choice of module may now show more detailed choices. For instance, whereas previously you would be offered a choice &quot;Tree value using character&quot;, now there will also be a list beneath it of the particular values available:<br> 
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="images/treeValues.jpg" width="315" height="283"><br>
                This  new default can be reverted to the old style by deselecting &quot;Show Subchoices in Module Dialogs&quot; in the Defaults submenu. Second, calculations that use characters or matrices can be set to use Stored Characters and Stored Matrices by default, without asking. This default may help novice users who otherwise would be confused by a request about simulations and so on. You can set this default as explained on the <a href="characters.html#source">Characters</a> page.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">The <strong>Defaults</strong> menu is now a submenu of the File menu, and is available from all windows.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>GenBank and GenPept import.</strong> Mesquite can
                  now import GenBank and GenPept files. If multiple files are dropped
                  onto a molecular matrix of the same sort (e.g., DNA), then
                  these sequences will be added to the matrix.</font></li>
                <li class="style4"><font face="Trebuchet MS">Drag and drop of FASTA files</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>New alignment tools</strong> (in the Align package):
			   	 </font><ul>
					<li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Align DNA to Protein</strong>. A DNA matrix can be aligned to match that of a translated amino acid alignment.</font></li>
					<li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Muscle Align</strong>. A portion of a sequence matrix can be sent to MUSCLE to be aligned and then reimported back into the matrix.</font></li>
					<li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Shift to Minimize Stop Codons</strong>. Sequences will individually be shifted 0, 1, or 2 based to minimize the number of stop codons
					in each sequence.  This is useful to set the reading frame of each sequence, for example for subsequent translation to amino acids.</font></li>
				</ul>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Tree of Life Web Project linking</strong> and other online databases.  Trees from the Tree of Life Web Project can 
				be downloaded and navigated.  In addition, a new tool in the tree window will search for taxon names in various on-line databases, including TreeBase, iSpecies, etc. </font></li>
			    <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Export NEXUS Tree File</strong>. This new exporter allows you to save a tree file (optionally including a taxa block) from a Mesquite project.</font></li>
			    <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">A <strong>Search Within Clade Tool</strong> is available in the
			      tree window. This tool rearranges the branches above the node
			      touched looking for a better tree.
			      The objective function used (e.g., treelength, or something
			      else) can be chosen by the user. This is similar to MacClade's

In previous versions it paid little attention to branch lengths, simply using the same convention as when a user moves branches.

The user however must specify what portion of branch lengths to put on new branches formed during the resolution.</font></li>

			    <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" alt="" width="14" height="14">) Deep coalescences were miscounted if a species or population lacked any containing genes. Such a species or population would contribute -1 to the deep coalescence count in such a circumstance (it should have contributed 0). This could, for instance, result in a deep coalescence score of a negative number, but it could also simply lower the total. This bug did not affect relative scores among trees (as long as they contained the same set of populations and genes) and so many analyses, such as searching for optimal species trees, would be unaffected. This bug was fixed in build j28 of version 2.01. The very first build of 2.01, j27, released for a few hours, has this bug.</font></li>

                  the Log window, at the bottom). Enter text there and hit Return, 
                  and the text will be sought. There are several modes, marked 
                  by different symbols:

                      returns a description of those features matching ALL of 
                      the search terms</font></li>

                      through information about Mesquite's features and returns 
                      a description of those features matching ANY of the search 
                      terms</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>d</strong> &#8212; Search Data: searches the current

                  </ul>
                  <font face="Trebuchet MS">You can choose the mode by touching on the symbol until the 
                  desired mode appears. In the Search Features modes, the results 
                  also give indication as to how the feature might be accessed. 
                  (There may even be a <strong>Try It!</strong> link that offers 
                  to invoke the feature.)</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>New windowing system </strong>&#8212; By default, all of the windows of a single project now 
                appear as tabbed panels within a single window. This change was 
                made to limit window proliferation. If you want to &quot;pop out&quot; 
                a tab to be a separate window, hit the curved arrow button within 
                the tab (you can &quot;pop in&quot; the window again using the 
                curved arrow button at the upper left side of the separated window). 
                You can revert to the old system of many windows using the Open 
                Windows as Tabs item in the Defaults submenu of the File menu. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Wizard-style dialogs</strong> &#8212; In many contexts 
                  Mesquite needs to ask a series of questions when a feature is 
                  requested. In previous versions these would appear as a series 
                  of dialog boxes; in version 2 these now appear as a single dialog 
                  that moves from one question to another, in the style of a wizard. 
                  This change was made to make an area in the dialog to give a 
                  more thorough explanation of the request, and to minimize the 
                  visual distraction of changing dialog sizes. You can revert 
                  to the old style of separate dialog boxes (which may work better 
                  on some operating systems) using the Use Wizard-style Dialogs 
                  item of the Defaults submenu of the File menu. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Diverse package</strong> &#8212; There is a new package 
                  of modules that estimates and simulates models of speciation 
                  and extinction. Some of its features are: 
                  </font><ul>
                    <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Estimating speciation/extinction rates</font></li>

                  Coalescence within a population/species tree can now be simulated 
                  with a selected rate of migration per generation among populations. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Trace Character Over Trees</strong> &#8212; This feature 
                  has been improved in several ways. The fraction of trees without 
                  a node is now shown, as is the fraction of trees with the node 
                  but not counted as they have ambiguous state assignment (by 
                  whatever criteria are chosen). The states at the terminal taxa 
                  are now shown. There is a new calculation mode, Average Frequencies 
                  Across Trees, available if the ancestral state reconstruction 
                  module yields frequencies or probabilities; this calculates, 
                  for each state, the average frequency across all trees (including 
                  trees in which the frequency for that state is very low or zero). 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Sample Trees Directly from File</strong> (now called Sample Trees from Separate File) &#8212; One 
                  can choose as a source of trees a random subsample of the trees 
                  contained within a treefile. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Undo</strong> &#8212; You can now undo some changes 
                  you might make to the character matrix in the character matrix 
                  window. In particular, edits of an individual cell, or changes 
                  made by the items in the Matrix&gt;Alter/Transform menu, are 
                  now undoable. Other changes (e.g., deleting a character) are 
                  not yet undoable. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Consensus sequences</strong> &#8212; One or more consensus 
                  sequences can be displayed in the character matrix editor. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Adding sequences to an existing matrix</strong> &#8212; 
                  FASTA or NBRF files dropped onto a matrix of DNA or protein 
                  sequences can be read in and appended to those matrices. 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Fusing genes to single matrix</strong> &#8212; In 
                  concatenating matrices, you can now contatenate matrices with 
                  different sets of taxa, facilitating fusion of different genes 
                  into a single matrix 
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Alternative naming schemes for taxa</strong> &#8212; 
                  This feature was introduced in version 1.1 as &quot;Archived 
                  names&quot;. It has been expanded to permit multiple <a href="taxa.html#alternativeNames">archived 
                  naming schemes</a>.
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Matrix coloring to aid manual sequence alignment</strong> 
                  &#8212; There are two new Color Cells options that aid with 
                  manual alignment. One (&quot;Aligning Colors&quot;) uses colors 
                  that emphasize purine-pyrimidine differences; the other highlights 
                  sections that appear to be slightly misaligned.
                </font><li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Various other smaller improvements have been made, for instance 
                  you can now import a PHYLIP tree file directly (without having 
                  to establish a taxa block first), and you can choose darker 
                  colors when assigning colors to objects.

                  There was a bug in writing decimal numbers as strings. Frequently, 
                  the 7th or 8th significant decimal place of a number would be 
                  written incorrectly. This did not affect how data were stored 
                  in the file; it affected only the reporting of results and screen 
                  display. This is unlikely to have a serious effect on published 
                  results for two reasons. First, it usually affected only the 
                  7th or 8th significant decimal place. Second, the situations 
                  in which it affected a more important decimal place were obscure 
                  and perhaps rarely used by users. These are: Density output 
                  in Scattergram; Parameters Explorer for newer likelihood calculations; 
                  Location of changes in Stochastic Character Mapping. In these 
                  cases, the 3rd or 4th decimal place could be affected. This 
                  bug has been fixed.</font></li>

                  On Windows operating systems, pasting into the data matrix often 
                  resulted in the loss of the first character of some rows. This 
                  may have been benign, but occasionally would result in data 
                  being pasted incorrectly (e.g. 1.234 received as 0.234). This

                  In versions 1.1 and 1.11 of Mesquite several of the simulations 
                  and randomizations had a bug in choosing the random number seed 
                  for the first item simulated or the first randomization. The 
                  designed behavior is for the simulations to begin with a random 
                  number seed based on the current clock, and then from that calculate 
                  base seeds for each of the replicates using the procedure described 
                  below under version 1.1 bug fixes. Version 1.12 has been corrected 
                  to use this designed behavior. However, in 1.1 and 1.11 for 
                  several of the simulations the first replicate always used 1 
                  as its random number seed, although all subsequent replicates 
                  used the correct method as designed. This bug did not affect 
                  independence of replicates within a simulation of multiple replicates 
                  (except when multiple tree blocks were simulated using &quot;Simulated 
                  Tree Blocks&quot;), but it did affect independence among separate 
                  simulations/randomizations. Since the bug affected only the 
                  first replicate, it would not be expected to affect significance 
                  values unless very few replicates were used. The affected simulations/randomizations 
                  are: Simulated Trees (first tree used seed 1 always); Simulated 
                  Tree Blocks (first tree of each block used seed 1 always); Randomly 
                  Modify Trees (first tree used seed 1 always); Randomly Modify 
                  Matrices (first matrix used seed 1 always).</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">(<img src="images/prerelease.gif" width="14" height="14">) 
                  When taxa are selected by the user and Rarefy Tree is used to 
                  generate trees with a requested number of taxa randomly deleted, 
                  taxa are chosen for deletion randomly only from among those 
                  currently selected. In previous versions of Mesquite this did 
                  not work correctly, in that frequently fewer than the requested 
                  number of taxa were deleted. This may have been evident to the 
                  user because the modified tree would have contained more taxa 
                  than expected. This bug is fixed in 1.12.</font></li>

                  The likelihood calculations for categorical characters were 
                  designed only for characters with a contiguous series of states 
                  starting at 0, and to prohibit other characters. That is, a 
                  character with states 0, 1, 2 would be permitted, but a character 
                  with states 1 and 2, or a character with states 0 and 2, would 
                  not be permitted. This requirement was mentioned in the manual, 
                  but the requirement was not enforced properly within the program, 
                  and thus Mesquite permitted the calculations with some such 
                  characters. The reconstructions are incorrect. In version 1.12 
                  the prohibition is correctly in place; Mesquite will refuse 
                  to calculate likelihoods with such characters.</font></li>

                  A single character matrix can be modified from various windows, 
                  such as the List of Characters window (e.g., by moving, deleting 
                  characters) and the Character Matrix Editor. When a character 
                  matrix editor is open and a cell is being edited, the editing 
                  field could sometimes be misapplied to the wrong character or 
                  taxon if elsewhere characters or taxa are deleted, added or 
                  changed in order. The effect of this is that the state of one 
                  character or taxon can get copied inadvertantly to another character 
                  or taxon. This bug has been fixed.</font></li>

                  which a branch was given a color slightly offset from its correct 
                  color according to the legend and its state value. (The correct

                  In previous versions of Mesquite, simulations and randomizations 
                  of trees and characters used a shortcut to go to the n'th replicate, 
                  cycling the (pseudo-)random number generator n times before 
                  entering the replicate. This caused adjacent replicates to be 
                  not entirely independent. In most cases we expect this bug would 
                  not have had a biasing effect if sample sizes were large. This 
                  bug has been fixed by adding 1 to the random number seed after 
                  cycling n times to generate independent random number sequences

                  is also available in the List of Taxa window (for annotating 
                  taxa) and the List of Characters window (for annotating characters). 
                  In the list windows, the panel can be requested by touching

                  View is used for a matrix, a <strong>Bird's Eye Closeup Strip</strong> 
                  appears below the matrix so that you can more clearly see the 
                  states of the characters of focus. Both of these strips can

                  Order</strong> of characters is automatically stored as characters 
                  are created. This default order is visible in the List of Characters 
                  window as the first column. If the order of characters is accidentally 
                  or intentionally changed (for instance using the <strong>Sort 
                  Tool</strong>) then the default order can be recovered easily 
                  by applying the Sort Tool to the Default Order column of the 
                  List of Characters window. In addition, you can store and reload 
                  other character orderings by showing the <strong>Stored Character 
                  Order</strong> in the List of Characters window (Columns menu). 
                  You can store the current ordering and recover previously stored 
                  orderings using the drop down menu from the Stored Order column 
                  heading. When you do this, you will see the numbers in the column 
                  change, but the characters will not immediately be reordered. 
                  The reason for this is that what is stored and displayed is 
                  simply a number for each character marking its position. It 
                  is up to you to use that ordering to resort the characters. 
                  Thus, to recover a former sequence of characters, load the stored 
                  ordering, then touch on its column with the sort tool. </font></li>

                      do the following: select the sequence in Mesquite, choose

                      and paste the sequence as the search string.</font></li>

                  changed (for instance, to re-read a tree file saved with different 
                  taxon names). The IDs will also be used in database connectivity

                  the IDs are stored in the Taxa block and Characters block of 
                  the NEXUS file, which causes some programs to refuse to read

                  fixed bug in two tree simulators, <strong>Uniform speciation 
                  (Yule)</strong> and <strong>Uniform Speciation with Sampling</strong>. 
                  In versions 1.03 and before, these failed to randomize tip labels, 
                  resulting in trees whose shapes matches the model's expectations, 
                  but whose particular relationships did not. Thus, in previous 
                  versions the taxa were added one at a time to a tree growing 
                  through time. For example, if there are 6 taxa, then the divergence 
                  between the 6th taxon and its sister species was always the 
                  most recent divergence in the tree. While this would not affect 
                  questions about general tree symmetry (e.g. &quot;What is the 
                  distribution of tree asymmetries under uniform speciation?&quot;) 
                  or branch length distributions, it would affect questions about 
                  similarity between an observed tree and those expected under

                  in the Log window or Projects &amp; Files window select Automatic 
                  NEXUS backup in the Defaults submenu of the File menu. Indicate the number of backups 
                  to be saved. If you enter, for instance, 3, then when you save 
                  a file named &quot;myfile&quot;, the previous version of the 
                  file (if any) will be retained and named myfileBKP1. It will 
                  be in the same directory as myfile. The version before that 
                  will be called myfileBKP2, the version before that myfileBKP3. 
                  When you save the files again, the file ending in BKP3 will 
                  be deleted, BKP2 will be named BKP3, BKP1 renamed BKP2, and 
                  the newest backup will be called myfileBKP1.</font></li>

                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">fixed a bug that caused NOTES blocks 
                  to be written in duplicate form into all linked files (opened 
                  via Link File...) if all files were saved. This bug was generally 
                  innocent except if a linked file was subsequently unlinked from 
                  the main data file. This would leave the linked file with a 
                  relictual copy of the NOTES block. If the main data file was 
                  then edited (e.g., footnotes changed, characters deleted or 
                  moved), and then the secondary file was later linked again to 
                  the main data file, its relictual (and now out of date) NOTES 
                  block could override the current NOTES block in the main file. 
                  This could cause footnotes in the main data file to revert to 
                  former ones, or to be applied to inappropriate characters or 
                  taxa. In addition to fixing this bug, we have added a warning 
                  that is given if Mesquite detects that a NOTES block is being 
                  overridden. If you suspect that your footnotes may have been

              <ul>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>multiple notes with images</strong> 
                  can now be associated with taxa, characters and cells of character 
                  matrices. Prior to 1.02 a single image could be associated with 
                  each taxon, or a single footnote could be associated with each 
                  taxon, character or cell of the matrix. Now, multiple notes 
                  can be attached to each taxon, character, or cell of a matrix. 
                  Each note can have a comment, a reference, an image, and an 
                  author. Labels can be attached to the image. <em>To use this</em>, 
                  select the notes tool (<img src="images/notesTool.gif" width="16" height="16">) 
                  in the Character Matrix Editor. If you touch on a cell, a <a href="characters.html#annotations">Annotations 
                  window</a> will appear with the notes for that cell, if any. 
                  Buttons in this window can be used to delete and add notes and 
                  images, and to make additional notes windows. Behavior of the 
                  window can be modified using its Annotations menu. NOTE: the 
                  single footnote system still exists and is independent of this 
                  multiple notes system.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>MRP matrices</strong> can 
                  be generated from a set of trees, for use by Matrix Representation 
                  with Parsimony analyses to construct supertrees. To use this, 
                  select MRP Matrices from trees as a source of matrices (e.g., 
                  under Characters menu, Make New Matrix submenu, Other Choices).</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">a <strong>search facility</strong> 
                  has been added to the Character Matrix editor and to the List 
                  windows. The cell of the matrix found by the search is highlighted 
                  and made visible. <em>To use this</em>, select Find String or 
                  Find Footnote from the Edit menu. Find String searches through 
                  the row names first (e.g., taxon names for the Character Matrix 
                  Editor), then the column names (e.g., character names), then 
                  the internal cells of the table (e.g., the character state codings). 
                  Find Footnote searches the footnotes of the Character Matrix 
                  and highlights cells containing the requested text in their 
                  footnotes. You can also search for stretches of sequences or 
                  state distributions matching the currently selected stretch 
                  using Select Same Sequence and Select Same Distribution of the 
                  Select menu of the Character Matrix Editor.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">More choices were added for <strong>coloring 
                  character matrices</strong>. Both text and background of a cell

                  tool (<img src="images/color.gif" width="16" height="16">) was 
                  added to allow arbitrary coloring of cells of a character matrix.</font></li>

                  windows. Prior to 1.02 taxa and characters could be moved by 
                  clicking and dragging, but using this it was difficult to move 
                  them long distances through a matrix. <em>To use this</em>, 
                  select the taxa or characters to be moved in their respective 
                  List window, and select Move Selected from the List menu.</font></li>

                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">added on-the-fly<strong> filtering

                  criteria or can be transformed with the available tree or branch 
                  length alterers. <em>To use this</em>, whenever a source of 
                  trees is needed, choose first &quot;Filter Trees from Other 
                  Source&quot; (if you want to select trees satisfying a criterion; 
                  more details <a href="trees.html#filtering">here</a>) or &quot;Transform

                  e.g. reroot, scale branch lengths, etc.; more details <a href="trees.html#modifying">here</a>), 
                  then indicate what source of trees is to be filtered or transformed, 
                  and what filter or transformation is to be used.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">added module to <strong>read trees

                  of much larger tree files (&gt;50,000 trees). <em>To use this</em>, 
                  request &quot;Use Trees from Separate File&quot; as your source 
                  of trees for charts and other calculations. You can also build 
                  a tree block from a sample of trees from a large file by selecting 
                  &quot;Include partial contents&quot; from the &quot;Import File

                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">added a new tree alterer: <strong>outgroup

                  choose the menu item &quot;Root tree with selected taxa as outgroup&quot;, 
                  for instance in the Alter/Transform Tree submenu of the Tree

                <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">added <strong>integrated BLAST search</strong>. 
                  <em>To use this</em>, go to a character matrix editor window 
                  showing a molecular matrix. Select one or more stretches of 
                  sequence and choose BLAST Search from the Search submenu of 
                  the Matrix menu. Mesquite will then send a request to your web 
                  browser to perform a BLAST search at NCBI's BLAST server, one 
                  request for each of the selected stretches of sequence. The
