To Run Mesquite

To run Mesquite, you need Java installed.  Mesquite 2 runs only on Java 1.4 and higher.  We suggest Java 1.5 or higher.

Once Mesquite_Folder is installed, you can start Mesquite as follows:

==================
Mac OS X
There are 3 ways to start Mesquite under OS X:

1. Default: Double click Mesquite OSX.app

2. To run Mesquite with more memory: Double click Mesquite OSX (hi-mem).app  (Hint: if you want to adjust the memory allocated, right click on the application's icon, go to info.plist in Contents, and change Xmx512M to Xmx700M or higher)

3. Or, to adjust how exactly Mesquite starts, including memory allocation:
Run Mesquite by double clicking the file Run_MesquiteOSX.command.  If double clicking this file does not start Mesquite, select the file in the Finder, choose Get Info, and change the "Open With" to "Terminal.app", which is in /Applications/Utilities/

To give Mesquite even more memory, open the file with a text editor and edit the line:

java  -Xmx500M -Xss2m -Djava.library.path=lib -cp . mesquite.Mesquite

To give Mesquite more memory in general, increase the number 500, but don't introduce any spaces!  
If you have more than 5000 taxa, you may have trouble using trees because of a stack size limit.  In that case, change the setting -Xss2m to -Xss4m (which should permit trees of size 10000) or even larger. 


==================
Windows

There are 3 ways to start Mesquite under Windows:

1. Default: use the installer and double click Mesquite.exe

2. To run Mesquite with more memory: use the alternative high memory installer (available at mesquiteproject.org), reinstall Mesquite, and double click Mesquite.exe.

3. Or, to adjust how exactly Mesquite starts, including memory allocation:
Run Mesquite by double clicking the file run_mesquiteWindows.bat.  To give Mesquite even more memory, open the file with a text editor and edit the line:

ava  -Xmx500M -Xss2m -Djava.library.path=lib -cp . mesquite.Mesquite

To give Mesquite more memory in general, increase the number 500, but don't introduce any spaces!  
If you have more than 5000 taxa, you may have trouble using trees because of a stack size limit.  In that case, change the setting -Xss2m to -Xss4m (which should permit trees of size 10000) or even larger.
