Align ToDo

	Ã move ClustalAlign files so that they are in Mesquite_Support_Files		
	- allow reincorporation to deal with only some sequences selected
	Ã ShiftOtherToMatch should have the flexibility MacClade currently does
	- AlignScoreForTaxon lets one choose sequence to match
	
	- test code

	Basic Pairwise Aligner:
		- have it deal properly with ambiguity codes
		- deal with terminal gaps with lower cost
		- give it access to a cost matrix
		- GUI for costs
		- preferences
