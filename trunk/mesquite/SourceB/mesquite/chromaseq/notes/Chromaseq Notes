PhredPhrap
	- change PrimerList file structure
	- explore flipping sequence but not chromatogram
	
	- URGENT: if users add matrices, the chrom viewing might not realize which matrix is the original and which is edited.  NEED to have these matrices indelibly marked
	- URGENT: crash when using PhredPhrap: is this just FileDialog flakiness?
	
	- what if user chooses the wrong directory?
	- menu rearrangment
  
	- test on Windows
	- add note about polymorphisms to help string
	- should place parameters in file comment
	- should put original chromatogram file names in footnote for each taxon.
	
	- append sequences: will the file remember the directory these new chromatograms etc. are in?
	- make sure it works under other shells on the Mac
	- don't rely on matrix names to find quality matrix etc.; attach some information 
	
	Ã URGENT: lack of saving of link to chromatograms if one relies upon autosave
	Ã use Open Other menu to do PhPh, and then hit cancel; new empty project should be removed.

Chromatogram Viewer
	- tool to remove selected bases from matrix
	* reverse complement
	* change the internal numbering system so that it uses a deeper, universal numbering that is independent of any existing numbering
	- double-clicking on matrix line at times zeros horizontal scroll bar
	- Notiophilus biguttatus 589 28S offset
	
	- move to matrix if all gaps in matrix (Wayne)
	- move to matrix set to lower case, or at least pay attention to case in import
	- move to matrix does not work if there is a base in that read that is not present in the Phred.Phrap.Mesquite sequence
	- on Move To Matrix mark cells as Touched
	
	- Test for alignment issues if sequences have been aligned
	- use i-beam for editing
	- arrange for auto coloring yellow (touched) when bases inserted AND when editing in matrix???
	- drawing SLOWER NOW (Wayne)
	- sequence moved down from read can't be selected; might not be editable
	- new ChromInit module: reads primer sequences from file, then does match against reads and highlights where primers on in reads
	- highlighting of regions where good forward and backward reads
	- conservative mode that marks To Check all cells for which there is conflict among reads
	- adjust trace heights individually, or have non-proportional mode in which they are individually autoscaled
	- Restore from Original, fills selected region with states form original matrix.  If beyond original, don't touch
	- shift highlight colors to darker
	
	Ã selection offset away from center
	Ã can't select or manipulate inserted bases; they act as if they belong to prior base
	Ã URGENT: if multpile contigs, touching on taxon should ONLY BRING UP window for that contig, and it should be named correctly
	Ã- shift select region of matrix; currently selects only one site in chrom viewer window
	Ã permit thumbs up/down/etc cursors chromat. window

	old bug list
¥¥¥ one of the reads is off on selection by 1/2 site; seems that findConsensusPosition in ChromatogramPanel is broken
Ã  findConsensusBaseNumber in ChromatogramPanel is off by up to three or more positions if you click off of the midline.  E.g., if the panel is centred on 40, and you click on 30, you'll get 26; if you click on 50 you'll get 55
¥¥¥ gaps are considered but just at face value; editing by hand something to be a gap will screw things up (need to associate flag with cells that were called as non-gaps originally)

	
	
	
	
QualityData, originalData
	- shift other to match selected in align has to move qualityData too!
	- ?? set special identifier keys in originalData, etc. not only for cross linking but also for later fusion (i.e. "28S")
	
=====
AFTER VERSION 1	
PhredPhrap
	- regular expression parsing of file names (Danny)
	- option to do as polymorphism OR uncertainty OR both
	- polymorphism vs uncertainty:  peak height, height of neighboring peaks, quality of read on either side, if neighboring peaks share a base
	- uses XML files for primerList, sample code translation file
	
	- modifies phd files too with base calls
	- drag on drop for adding new files to contig
	- can excise file from contig
	
Chromatogram Viewer
	- bird's eye view showing read patterns
