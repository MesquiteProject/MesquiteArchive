				setExplanation 'The second method to analyze gene copies within species or populations is to manage TaxaAssociation blocks by hand. ^n^nThis was the method I used to create this file.  First, I chose "New" from the File menu.  I indicated the file name in the file dialog box.  Then, when the dialog box came up asking me about a set of taxa, I entered the name ("Species"), and how many taxa (3).  In the taxa list window (e.g., at left), I renamed the taxa (species A, B, C). Next, I made the second set of taxa (e.g., "Genes") by selecting the "New set of taxa" menu item in the Taxa&Trees menu.^n^nNext, I began to indicate how the one set of taxa fits into the other set of taxa.  To do this, I created an "TaxaAssociation" block in the data file (there isn''t a fancy editor for this yet, just a crude one).  I did this by selecting "New Association" in the Taxa&Trees menu.  I was asked to identify the two sets of taxa to be associated (usually it''s easier to choose species first), and presented with a simple text editor in a dialog box. ^n^nThis text editor starts off with an example TaxaAssociation block, which is complete but incorrect in that all of the genes are placed under the first species.  I edit this text following the model, placing each gene with its correct species.  Each row in the ASSOCIATES command needs to end in a comma except for the last.  For instance, with these data a possible ASSOCIATES command would be:^n^nASSOCIATES ^n	speciesA /  geneA1 geneA2 , ^n	speciesB /  geneB, ^n	speciesC /  geneC1 geneC2 ^n;^n^nI entered this.  Then, I closed the Association block window.  This caused the block to be processed.  ^n^nIf you want to see the Association block editor, choose Edit Association from the  Taxa&Trees menu.^n^nTo see the next step in analyzing gene trees within species trees, hit the button "Next".';
