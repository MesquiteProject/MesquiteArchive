First, however, you may want to take from Mesquite_Folder/mesquite   any third party packages (e.g., PDAP, TreeSetViz) before deleting the directory.</p><p>In order to run Mesquite, you must have Java installed on your computer. We  recommend you install the latest version of Java before installing Mesquite  (<a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>). <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">Java    Standard Edition 5.0</a> is suitable (JRE 5.0).</p>		<p>Instructions:</p><ol>  <li>Download the <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquiteDownload/MesquiteInstaller.exe">Mesquite     Installer</a></li>  <li>Run the installer. It runs as a wizard. Once it is done, you should see     a Mesquite folder something like this:<br>    <br>    <img  src="images/installWin.jpeg" width="658" height="558"><br>  </li>  <li>The file &quot;Mesquite&quot; with the icon is the Mesquite executable.     Double click this to start Mesquite.</li></ol><h3>Misbehavior of Mesquite under Windows</h3>		<p>At least under older versions of Windows and Java, the menus of Mesquite may   occasionally show incorrect headings (this is apparently due to a bug in the   Java Virtual machine, not due to a bug in Mesquite). For this reason there is   a Reset Menus item in the File menu; it should help restore the correct menus.</p>		<p>More details of issues of using Mesquite under Windows are described in the   <a href="../../Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/support.html#knownVMBugs">Support</a>   page.</p>		<p>		<hr>Copyright 2002-2006 W. &amp; D.
